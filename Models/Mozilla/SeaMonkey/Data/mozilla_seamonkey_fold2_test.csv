whatever s url bar time rather url current loaded page regardless url bar displays noticed refuting someone s claim way go certain url cut pasting url bar argued pasting could drag file icon content area go first thought new behavior ns anyways good reason stated keyboard input essentially required go url thus way getting rid absolute need go button however upon rethinking m quite sure accidentally typing url bar later dragging icon bookmarks would cause bookmark wrong url produced would situation dragging icon external program desktop shortcut ever get working could potentially confusing old ns users n t adapted new system icon s url bar rather page s loaded new way pros cons m wondering design intentional meant work way ns x think comment blake ross pdt forgot finish

pdt ben slamm working know fixed n x later sure wrong give bug re assign kill comment jesse ruderman pdt came bug comment matthew paul thomas pdt far user concerned proxy icon represents currently loaded page think dragged really create bookmark shortcut link whatever currently loaded page whatever happens location bar time otherwise could easily create bookmarks shortcuts links whatever invalid addresses mangled contents location bar going copied location entirely mouse probably want paste go item context menu location bar comment gwyn judd pdt hand scheme could create link wrong page dragging url icon thingy thinking url bar actually currently loaded page strongly object url icon thingy right beside url bar people bound think produces shortcut thing url bar idea context menu one get right clicking control clicking whatever item called create shortcut click drag shortcut menu way drag shortcut url bar currently except shortcut get time current page would make much sense since click page get shortcut page click url bar get shortcut url n t even know could done think would incredibly cool imagine first time user bringing context menu seeing create shortcut clicks menu disappears left holding little shortcut icon drag desktop food thought comment matthew paul thomas pdt sounds bit hairy would inconsistent every drag and drop action know mouse dragging suggestion would equivalent something glued hand perhaps better idea clicking proxy icon automatically restore contents location bar address current document real address page click proxy icon ah way d always dragging address shown location bar comment gwyn judd pdt sounds bit hairy would inconsistent every drag and drop action know mouse dragging suggestion would equivalent something glued hand s really meant though meant click create shortcut menu item release button menu goes away user left holding url icon dragged wherever want way inconsistency since would holding mouse drag hate disagree way see whole purpose url icon proxy icon whatever provide convenient spot click create draggable shortcut really wanted behaviour would n t better create button produce effect perhaps better idea clicking proxy icon automatically restore contents location bar address current document real address page click proxy icon ah way d always dragging address shown location bar comment jesse ruderman pdt would starting drag url icon count clicking restore url page url side note asked escape key revert url pressing escape clicking url icon revert url would nice would allow keyboard only mouse only people happy comment blake ross pdt gwyn would pretty cool matthew said goes every drag and drop convention ve seen matthew s idea work pretty well perhaps see instances people accidentally click icon typing long address expecting restore url bar loaded address granted would n t happen often tooltip popups mouse icon perhaps shorter delay others address loaded page people would know icon s linking still ca n t imagine many instances people would go trouble typing address url bar _just_ purpose dragging icon create shortcut bookmark real desire going page users likely used ns way things vote keeping way another thought system like ie s realized functioned ie keeps file icon visible second user changes text address bar loaded url point icon becomes invisible although space icon still draggable dragging nothing disagree design s nothing n t able drag thus keep system like ns x s help avoid confusion simply making icon disappear altogether user voluntarily changes text url bar comment verah

would assumed behavior bottom line arrows purpose clearing url bar jake comment ohely pdt additional consequence bug comes recent nightly builds m keyboard shortcut close window ctrl w rather alt w m alt shortcut worked focus still url bar ctrl shortcut blanks url bar comment jacob kjome pdt s interesting issue url disappearing key up down seems fixed behavior url bar still focused upon opening

consider leaving focus url bar lot people included obviously expect pageup pagedown updownarrows going active page loads new browser window opened classic sequence m reading something like slashdot want middle click linux number links let load m browsing main page get page navigation arrows pageup down keys work without clicking page body imparts horrible ui cost move mouse move pointer body click move back keyboard everyone uses mouse navigate see absolutely reason url bar focus newly loaded page page going read immediately replaced typing new url sorry get vehement huge issue imo speed browsing pain rear keep getting mouse scroll page least make option set ignore rest heathens bug nearly bad inactive left arrow back button comes using browser keyboard one final note could care less ie old netscape n t give url bar focus n t expect mozilla either comment jacob kjome pdt ok think agree scott sure saw ie n t give immediate keyboard navigation retested documents opened window open also tested ns gives immediate keyboard focus way actually case found either ie ns give focus default url bar m sure mozilla either top issue url disappearing said fixed must complete fluke build tried posted last message appeared fixed problem acted described however back clearing url hit either keys up down keys url bar focus either anytyhing move list url s ve visiting like ie first url nothing nothing else disappearing url bar needs fixed would incredibly nice would urge fixed fix keyboard pgup pgdn focus default problem least url disappear user jake comment matthew paul thomas pdt give location field focus window opened using file new shortcut give page focus new window opened method open new browser window using file new re likely want use visiting particular url whereas open means e g open link new window re likely want scroll contents instead comment jacob kjome pdt sounds reasonable however look ie s behavior open new window previously opened browser grabs entire session state old browser use backtrack pages times development case n t usually change url hit back button want start new clean browser session click ie icon get fresh new browser window even case highlight text get rid eg blank stated home page manually put focus anyway recommendation would forget automatic focus url bar altogether never save lot headache intuitive jake comment jesse ruderman pdt hoju ways remove blank location bar without mouse ctrl a shift home long url bar already focus seems rfe work would intuitive way move focus location bar page without scrolling first link page right n t think s way move focus location bar tab comment jacob kjome pdt s quite point making forget blank slightly different case window gets opened via say window open script target _blank reason

size want want really large click largest looking pretty small hit smaller however moz must continuously hit enlarge text size reduce text size finally get said real pain say need make text extremely

reduce text size currently accelerator key combo must visit cute little view menu every single time furthermore system like ie s text size submenu containing various size options would allow kind limit large small text unless n t want limit right seems text made large slowing things small want intended also envision type menu item proposed text size submenu would allow user enter size desired perhaps percentage original normal font i e let know think comment matthew paul thomas pdt several suggestions menus offer finite set text sizes choose save repetitive incremental sizing reduce text

enlarge reduce example user clicked enlarge medium checked larger would become checked user went past smallest largest menu item would checked sure like part suggestion potential confusion think menu important large improvement former system enlarge lot decide go back normal size continuously click reduce menu item remember normal size looks like comment brendan donohoe pdt n t think mechanism suggests artificial limits think current wording suggests finite range current wording also gives clue normal text size recommend ie slew products acrobat ms office etc use represent increasing decreasing text view size percentages way s obvious norm although range supplied s strictly limited like largest addition s much easier translate percentages dialog exactly would type bigger largest please enlarge reduce command pair want go overboard comment blake ross pdt ok change percentages easy enough still view text size view zoom could also something like largest xx larger xy etc want comment blake ross pdt also wider range menu itemes percentages wish percentages suggest menu items comment brendan donohoe pdt stay view text size since page scaled view zoom implies images everything else scale well also n t recommend largest xx since bears implied limits largest far percentages listed would recommend small range useful usable options cover entire range percentages available since unlikely users regularly want scale say text size example text size enlarge reduce also may stating obvious s important text size actually calculated percentage current magnification matches one percentages listed menu item checked show current zoom comment blake ross pdt ok ll try get changes today re going enlarge reduce rather agreed like better still need work bryner getting menu checkmark update user changes font size via mousewheel matthew agree everything said percentages brendan mentioned comment matthew paul thomas pdt menu name text si_ze z mnemonic future ability scale pixel objects e g graphics well would scaling threshold allow us make text smaller larger certain degree leaving graphics original size n t get scaled slightly therefore unattractively scale text happens menu become _zoom z mnemonic forwards compatible use larger smaller enlarge reduce reason gave bug ui grammar re manipulating verb something noun way adverb re viewing verb text noun smaller larger comparative degree adverb say text size text clarity purposes disturbs grammar little much using enlarge reduce verb would percentages used n t geometrically based harmonically based produce decent looking pixel sizes multiplied usual default size also s certain want scale text sizes percentage page text rendered px text px ll probably want scale px text want scale px text using fixed percentages might hot idea s problem another day need way making item obvious items something magnification menus apps usually fail spectacularly putting original size next would fulfil purpose nicely text si_ze s_maller ctrl _larger ctrl _ _ _ actually original si_ze using z makes easy select _ actually _ _ _other menu item shows last chosen custom scale default value dialog comment matthew

miminizes thinking involved picking zoom factor thereby allowing overall better user experience user easily pick zoom factor impulse also range sufficiently wide spread cater diverse situations including particular cases raised mpt comment brian ryner reading pdt noted bug need keybindings enlarging reducing text size done mousewheel shortcut pretty much go away marking dependency comment matthew paul thomas pdt blake peter anemma jag implementing sorry n t know e mail address could cc reassign ok objective find set zoom levels useful web pages monitors present future n t confuse user much up front choice provide complete user choice allowing user choose arbitrary zoom level absolute relative mechanisms co exist harmonious manner last criterion especially tricky see achieved like infinite scale steps smaller larger commands step absolute zoom levels menu set values happen surround therefore likely used immediate purposes calculations todd s suggested series based harmonic scale n signed number steps z n n n z n exception scale omits series would nice property extrapolated downwards smaller command would never crash two not so nice properties first consecutive activation smaller larger would reduce enlarge text noticably different percentage amount second ca n t continued larger purposes past get division zero neither problem ie mac afaik n t smaller larger first place instead think use geometric series z n n retains nice asymptotic property harmonic scale avoiding harmonic scale s problems given say round values reasonably whole numbers pass absolute values menu user understand rbs maths uq edu au rightly says large enough resize text heavily several hundred percent using smaller larger without taking many key presses obviously large interval use want reduce enlarge not quite perfect text pixels usual situation part scale covered absolute zoom level menu approach directions use different values smoothly bring interval values nearly fortunately time using reasonably round numbers menu scale used smaller larger looks like level interval part show menu part like text si_ze s_maller ctrl _larger ctrl _ _ _ original si_ze _ _ _ _other menu item shows last chosen custom level default value dialog leaves one detail happens smaller larger specify custom level well think whenever custom level part series defined considered step scale example let s say last custom level specified currently repeatedly choose larger zoomed detour scale take custom level back scale prevents possible situation use smaller larger step custom level enter opposite command find m back custom level different level scale comment fahrner pdt mpt writes neither problem ie mac afaik n t smaller larger first place sure simply takes next value fixed scale intervals n t apply tricky scaling factor reach upper lower extent scale larger smaller simply ceases effect seems work quite well practice since upper lower ends scale already quite uselessly dramatic makes good user control demo fodder macie lacks custom zoom level affordance case semantic larger smaller becomes problematic suggest snapping nearest interval fixed scale e g user picks either zoom hits larger interval goes smaller terribly sophisticated edge case comment matthew paul thomas pdt macie lacks custom zoom level affordance case semantic larger smaller becomes problematic suggest snapping nearest interval fixed scale s exactly suggested corollary also snap back last specified custom level diversion smaller larger scale comment fahrner pdt ok got sorry n t read carefully running late

hmmm mpt rendered current code useless infrastructure writing new code n t hard ll tomorrow btw good enough scaling factor think would scale like insane guess finetune code done assigning bug comment peter jag annema pdt accepting comment matthew paul thomas pdt note region around user likely scaling interval roughly scaling less m guessing user wanting move faster one minor clarification last specified custom zoom level necessarily level dialog defaults last specified custom zoom level zoom look menu dialog going say use smaller zoom back still going step scale last specified custom zoom

reason cpu one event queues processed gtk s mainloop processed wrong thread event queue created another thread n t allowed process thread except created understand happening important understand two different kinds thread queues mozilla native monitored native event queues queues use platform specific notification mechanism monitored event queue n t platform specific notification mechanism must polled retrieve process events see http lxr mozilla org seamonkey source xpcom threads plevent h information imap thread creating monitored event queue created activated observer notifying appshell

opposed creating new account involves configuring several things s whole point n t comment nathan peterson pst creating new identity made simple opposed creating new account involves configuring several things s whole point n t yeah simple nice unfortunately backend identities makes complicated want keep backend account options stored identities thus practically configure entire account identity however may worth considering changing backend people probably want email address changed per identity would make gui lot simpler comment luiz otavio zorzella pst honestly think creating new identity made complex creating new account gain nothing backend needs changed comment gus heck pst compose window simply two features type address remembers history addresses typed per account presents dropdown list remembered addresses nothing needs configured preference settings anywhere else autocomplete history perhaps way delete oopses history would also good n t know would take sure sounds simpler identity stuff would solve core problems relating advantages full blow identity thing beyound multiple addresses comment colin ogilvie cso pst reply comment however may worth considering changing backend people probably want email address changed per identity would make gui lot simpler personally would want different signature well although mail downloaded one account send emails different addresses representing organisations etc comment matt pst like idea history typed email addresses maybe s simple solution complex problem personally makes sense email addresses tied one identity literally one pop account virtuser entries tied pop account pop mail s grabbing mail multiple email addresses makes sense able send mail multiple email addresses want mail one place s sent n t search different identities comment jo rhett pst think focus original suggestions set top bug identity people name e mail address reply to organization signature would also suggest separate sent folders may desired outside re simply going make complex would easy get situations say identity gets filters view inbox going make complex stick original suggestions ll parity match outlook express eudora people looking comment gus heck pst ok signatures stuff nice long since read think maybe another way avoid lot configuration work users base identity set account alternate identities take default values unless otherwised configured thus type line suggestion could simply create identity spot overides name could later signature name whatnot added comment nathan peterson pst comment problem entering email address directly field mozilla n t know account using ie outgoing smtp server put fcc s drafts etc would love see implemented addition multiple identities would also able select account would additional part gui way select account seperate identity compose window would make things easier account settings dialog b c would n t bind multiple identities account would pick default one per account comment yeah agree email signature vcard name replyto organization per identity something like comment jo rhett pst worth opinion never seen environment account spanning identity makes sense every way ve ever used every way ve ever seen used identities tied accounts opinion separating going make work harder confuse people see zero gain naturally someone different experience mine could lay reasons would good idea comment frank sch nheit pst re talking sense multiple identities bug requests ability associate identity folder account instance different identities different mailing lists account d definately vote full blown identity administration may need make less obvious confuse unexperienced users since would ease later comment frank sch nheit pst identities names backend iirc m sure makes sense add one user_pref mail identity identity identityname name respected least dropdown compose window quite useful really multiple identities base email address comment matt pst actually reading recent posts think way outlook express following lead necessarily makes identity completely different user new inboxes new email addresses new filters new everything opinion s logical way one identity available given time comment frank sch nheit pst think way outlook express following lead necessarily makes identity completely different user new inboxes new email addresses new filters new everything please let s strength mozilla s identity concept freely organize mails including one inbox re really interested fact mails reach leave via different providers still lot flexibility settings btw bcc also extremly useful per identity setting comment ian holsman pst use multiple identies multiple accounts generic email addresses use personal mailing list role

couple news servers imap server mail comes server primary identity use mainly evolution method adding identities n t tied mailbox ie add email address comment tanner lovelace pst far ui examples go m sure evolution still way used let specify e mail account pick either pop imap none incoming mail source would let use current account setup identity separate account n t incoming mail sources comment nathan peterson pst yeah think tanner right people really need identities span account options would make sense make seperate accounts instead n t incomming servers thus n t show left plane messenger window perhaps would even make sense choice either making fake account work like identity lots options create identity could attached account specifies email name signature ect comment eugene gluzberg pst say definatelly allow type address matter identity backend comment constantine a murenin pst already bug editable form header comment friedrich lobenstock pst reply comment yeah think tanner right people really need identities span account options would make sense make seperate accounts instead n t incomming servers thus n t show left plane messenger window right current work around creating fake accounts folders defined main account one server settings disabled creates nasty entry left panel perhaps would even make sense choice either making fake account work like identity lots options create identity could attached account specifies email name signature ect fit needs d propably need options identity someone already suggested taking defaults main identity possible comment matt pst another ui example use quickbooks pro accounting trying switch gnucash quite yet type something n t recognize certain fields client vendor try save record pop wizard asking want setup quickadd cancel maybe quickadd could add current identity immediately setup would give wizard options comment nathan peterson pst created attachment details possible composer layout example would look like able select identity account seperately composer well able edit identity address directly think would ideal way assuming identity includes name email sig etc rest options associated account able create accounts n t show messenger plane comment ben bucksch benb pst think idea current design identity carries everything composer needs account merely keeping references one incoming server plus one identities accounts n t properties additionally smtp servers referenced identities identity uses default smtp server http www mozilla org mailnews arch accountmanager html overthrow whole idea app accounts servers identities d suggest build sensible ui current backend happen think s decent design ll see btw copying properties want change later comment nathan peterson pst reply comment think idea current design identity carries everything composer needs s true many settings part identity outgoing server used account merely keeping references one incoming server plus one identities accounts n t properties server identity properties properties account notice even name account technically listed server property yet s obviously meant considered account property additionally smtp servers referenced identities identity uses default smtp server smtp server server property identity property overthrow whole idea app accounts servers identities d suggest build sensible ui current backend make sound like s easier solution reality n t think easy way build sensible ui current backend would drastically change gui make work even s probably going make lot sense people change backend slightly require minimal gui changes lot easier implement comment nathan peterson pst opps smtp server linked identity s part server prefs bad comment frank sch nheit pst agree ben focus original idea bug creating ui current backend everything else separate bug though keep mind designing ui one personally like idea attachment details best though try prevent dialog box cascades implies redesigning am identities window suggested attachment details s self contained enough complete identity management think would good compromise easy access identity management confusing users n t want know identities much like layout suggested comment suppose s confusing many people comment matt pst whatever decided upon strongly urge everyone consider comment btw automatic reply address message sent could large part solved able give folder default identity would huge improvement email client m aware especially invention services configurations like http www spamgourmet com personally ve accidently replied mailing lists time time wrong email address m sure s spam originates ultimately regardless identities handled three goals mail regardless email address pop account shares folders want able compose quickly easily email addresses hit reply want automatically use email address email sent comment nathan peterson pst reply comment whatever decided upon strongly urge everyone

like idea attachment details best though try prevent dialog box cascades implies redesigning am identities window suggested attachment details s self contained enough complete identity management would like see self contained complete identity management window could please design one put attachment see talking n t see reasonably done agree sugested attachment details important keep mind b c changes whether design gui actually attach multiple identities account sets default identity s also way think fix bug b c need specify account seperately comment frank sch nheit pst orginal idea bug says nothing creating ui backend hmm subject ui multiple identities per account also see comment would like see self contained complete identity management window could please design one put attachment see talking n t see reasonably done quick shot use following identities account x identity add identity x identity identity remove identity v properties selected identity like today server settings ok cancel agree sugested attachment details important keep mind b c changes whether design gui actually attach multiple identities account sets default identity think suggested really different bug matter whether like n t think belongs bug s also way think fix bug b c need specify account seperately separate bug imo n t see need fix alltogether think one step time keeping next steps mind course n t redo things later comment nathan peterson pst reply comment orginal idea bug says nothing creating ui backend hmm subject ui multiple identities per account also see comment notice neither subject comment say anything creating ui backend picture drew comment properties selected identity server settings server settings supposed separate identity server settings maybe could cram little box probably actual identity settings basically options span multiple option windows way could fit box agree sugested attachment details important keep mind b c changes whether design gui actually attach multiple identities account sets default identity think suggested really different bug matter whether like n t think belongs bug know s different bug m saying needs taken consideration designing gui bug think re right btw changing backend least way suggested comment ben s comment made things little bit clearer despite fact disagreeing n t realizing identities contained information needed send email select email address messengercompose window actually selecting list identities s list accounts accounts identities anything like s identities little confusing b c account name even though identity attached one account list identity identity attached multiple accounts guess picks first account name propose identities given names separate accounts pretty easy servers names identities prefs entry like servers user_pref mail identity identity name myidentity also issue multiple identities attached single account m starting realize actually kind pointless user s perspective reason would attach identity account replying email particular account messengercompose knows default identity adding extra identity account n t anything confuses user think although could wrong reason backend supports attaching multiple identities account identities attached something wo n t get listed messengercompose window identities accounts accounts multiple identities really n t matter account attached long attached something show think either code changed identities show whether attached accounts extra identities randomly attached account covers without causing confusion user comment ben bucksch benb pst also issue multiple identities attached single account m starting realize actually kind pointless user s perspective n t think send email certain from replyto address ll get replies address end certain account pointless technical perspective current internet email infrastructure separates servers incoming outgoing mail n t much concern users advanced users however know take advantage comment nathan peterson pst reply comment also issue multiple identities attached single account m starting realize actually kind pointless user s perspective n t think send email certain from replyto address ll get replies address end certain account right happens whether identity attached account need attach pointless technical perspective current internet email infrastructure separates servers incoming outgoing mail n t much concern users advanced users however know take advantage hmm lost exactly advanced users take advantage fact extra identities attached account instead separate comment matt pst n t know everyone else m getting bit confused maybe s time define layman terms exactly piece come consensus maybe m one confused s understand piece someone fill gaps correct ll probably way identity one accounts share folders filtering rules address book second identity could setup users want keep email accounts seperate work email address home email address never wanted two mix could setup seperate identities folders accounts account email address signature pop imap server settings email address multiple email addresses tie pop imap account add one account per email address disable checking mail account would solely used bring list addresses drop way comment nathan peterson pst way yeah pretty much account server one identities thing differs accounts servers identities attached server includes options incoming server identity includes options related incoming server comment matt pst account group servers mail folders filters address book

fixed passing identities prefs entry like servers user_pref mail identity identity name myidentity see comment preference backend longer account names appear dropdown long time ago email addresses s nowhere available ui time discovered dropdown place respecting sure changed meantime m starting realize actually kind pointless user s perspective tend agree attaching identities account sounds like make available somewhere workaround though doubt somebody volunteers rewrite backend change even since n t think changing backend necessary gives use flexibility need want could probably chose completely different paradigm present user comment frank sch nheit pst account one one server attached server settings seperate servers accounts to n could use server different accounts least backend yes could continue asking comment ben bucksch benb pst send email certain from replyto address ll get replies address end certain account happens whether identity attached account need attach means logically related makes sense couple ui make completely independent mom n t even differentiate verizon mailbox incoming server corresponding email address identity verizon smtp server n t confuse plus

meeting portal c components must go trusted merely need implement certain interface native component loader trusts put local filesystem n t see js components treated differently like jband s patches hardcoding nsisidebar non starter anyway hardcoding like asking laundry list exceptions many would obtain nsisecuritycheckedcomponent scriptable propose reimplement sidebar code c rather js costing time code space bad pointer bugs leaks etc etc s defense in depth belt and braces case made jar recalls early java days js component loader make sure thing never loads component local user controlled filesystem storage maybe js component loader could check load time whether js component implements nsisecuritycheckedcomponent set extra flag checked later catch bugs js component loaded web html xml

fair enough comment eric hodel pdt adding bit suggest removing bookmarks menu leaving pt also believe remove confusion pt renamed bookmarks toolbar way user decides hide pt know wo n t able access bookmarks also makes sense leave bookmark functions clustered together one location comment stephen koren pdt opinion keep bookmarks menu also leave pt also leave name pt people n t like bookmarks hide pt think termite right idea poll mozillazine comment rann bar on pdt eric s suggestion sounds good bookmarks menu seem extranous observe menus except go menu functionality relates browser like preferances saving clipboard functions bits mozilla whilst bookmarks menu relates software does think seperating bookmarks main menu bar makes lot sense still think poll would provide best solution

sidebar bookmarks panel seems far away enough thta n t feel hesitation middle two locations comment jason kersey pdt m sure problem multiple access points bookmarks find personal toolbar button much

gnome m basically saying ignore linux gnome users opinions us may end using mozilla galeon nautilus unless magic way match gtk themes made doubt another thing consider n t match netscape exactly reason people like classic matches os perhaps someone could work new skin matches os yet looks better netscape comment bart szyszka pdt n t think classic necessarily ideal choice default skin imo s

pdt change priority and or severity is enhancement request albeit important one severity correct priority like target milestone assignee comment mike palumbo pdt is enhancement request albeit

interim least get things working better s view wait along people think like current layout need buttons propose adding going back way x works improvement eyes appearently real stakeholder s eyes additional comment blake ross agree marlon change like n t made customization features necessary allow user choose neil think attached patch correct fix bandaid like seperate address bar correct fix able customize toolbar liking checking hard coded version like look comment jason bassford pdt along people think like current layout reverse also true need buttons propose adding ve never proposed adding buttons proposed solution specific bug arguing personal opinions bug point pointless arguments made sides many people want see n t every comment quote quote one back s productive end nobody review proposed patch and or drivers wo n t allow checked kills want continue argue bug principle take newsgroups posts constructive and or address technical issues comment tobias tinkerman pdt ca n t land toolbar customization checked yeah well suppose give us update status toolbar customization point far m concerned s nowhere marlon said bug months months ago halfway spec another bug stated toolbar customizaition around corner corner probably roughly year ago s months away fine however feeling s nowhere near time frame would go long way help people bugs keep getting told wait toolbar

like seperate address bar wrong correct fix bug separating nav bar adress bar comment ren chucker kuklau gone pdt additional comment tobias tinkerman interim least get things working better rather advancement exactly quite see kerz s point implement would end toolbar dependant whether home moved patch buttons additional toolbar urlbar optional go button dependant patch maybe search button well like current layout though single toolbar except possibly home less buttons way less space used less space available urlbar part suffer implement would n t win everyone additional comment tobias tinkerman attached patch correct fix bandaid like seperate address bar wrong correct fix bug separating nav bar adress bar suppose bug invalid wontfix whatever comment jason bassford pdt suppose bug invalid wontfix whatever s module owner drivers marks time discussion best implement patch comment jason bassford pdt actually two alternatives ll mention even though know ui people would probably problem least first one keep existing combined toolbar also implement navigation bar address bar make default show nav address bar also possibility hiding making visible two separately way like happy want two separate also happy alternative module owner drivers would amenable rather simply marking wontfix would decision otherwise make bug dependant bug work continue patch parallel work might happening bug soon bug checked patch one could checked would mean nav address bar split two would option want joined horizontally appearing current want one would also get way currently bug dependant one dependancy would reversed i e re separating anything unless know ability put two pieces side side however say large part decision process based module owner drivers say subject module owner whoever s charge xp apps gui features think really need kind authoritative answer hopefully s one voice able speak comment alex bishop pdt marlon said bug months months ago halfway spec another bug stated toolbar customizaition around corner corner probably roughly year ago s months away fine however feeling s nowhere near time frame according bug comment marlon stopped working spec bossy people kept bothering comment ren chucker kuklau gone pdt additional comment jason bassford keep existing combined toolbar also implement navigation bar address bar make default show nav address bar also possibility hiding making visible two separately way like happy want two separate also happy sounds messy n t like alternative reverse dependency bug fix one first allow address bar within toolbar

wanting push pet peeve bugs forward bug hopeful url bar seperation toolbar customization stop trying make bug one big fix navigator ui might start seeing progress _this bug_ maybe need make tracking bug need navigator ui changes getting list needed navigator ui changes one meta bug would right direction go least better spamming bug sorry spam comment marlon bishop pdt hopefully aware completely sacrilegious nature activity please remember subsequent changes proposed would implemented way would permanently affect netscape wants keep current design toolbar customization pushed heavily next release happens work mutually benefical ideally would implemented browser could choose default toolbar arrangement least ideal focused let s turn bug validity one design another topic winable within confines bug comment jason bassford pdt marlon please clarify position bug saying netscape insisting bug related bugs get fixed netscape ready fixed would tantamount admitting netscape controls mozilla something s always publicly denied fact module owner work done may may mutually beneficial bug related bugs come halt due dissension lack clarity often perceived lack adherence procedures place address specific bugs least seems case n t bug bugzilla worked towards implementation new toolbar spec look galileo considered sacrilegeous yet correct viewpoint grin comment mike lee pdt bug marked wontfix imho people seem split toolbar arrangement customization developed one move address bar s bug move allow customisation folks seems want customisation first existing look maintained default people change wish two different way thinking inclinded go later method customise first leaving changing looks user bug basically force interface change maybe skins without advancing towards

ren chucker kuklau gone pst comment andreas kunz m probably average user d say anyone postes bugzilla ca n t considered average user purpose identical obvious entries context menu s true look like

folders example folder foo personal toolbar folder contains bookmarks bar baz boo folder bum contains bookmark nada bug applies bar baz boo bum nada foo supposed context menu note leave bookmarks manager aside right accessible within menus click foo opens menu containing bar amongst others re supposed right click bar problem open another menu context menu leaving one open question really convenient comment kenneth pst probably considered less average user personally ca n t relate frustrating context menu bookmarks usability standpoint huge hassle forced go manage bookmarks menu instead simply able right click rename sort bookmarks name forth becomes complicated present agree encourage bookmarks menu personal toolbar menu item able drag and drop managed context menu features may bulky windows newer versions windows great help comment peter lairo pst comment luckily currently possible rename delete folder foo context menu comment andreas kunz pst comment think re confusing things think express clearly bar baz etc things exactly meant understand bug agree wanted express opinion users especially not so geeky ones perceive folders personal toolbar folders function like menus menus technically therefore context menus items confusing comment jason bassford pst bug implementing context menus certain kind menu items namely bookmarks reside bookmark folders let s clarify statement bug inline context menus editing properties bookmarks anything renamed url changed least functions may may added later bookmark manager able edited inline also n t think carried away throwing kitchen sink bug get handful basic context menu functions bug satisfied enhancements added future bugs dealing already existing context menus bookmarks fact easiest way getting code thing simply re use existing code already bookmark manager way right click bookmark item inline behave exactly d right clicked bookmark item within bookmark manager s need reinvent wheel things currently n

inside menus omg practice actually quite easy usable implemented non annoying way agree comment say browsing bookmarks menu see one wrong name wrong folder first thing one tries alter spot via drag drop context menu whatever immediate method remember open _separate window_ navigate way back alter one bookmark annoying distracting feels like forgetting office keys home users browsed bookmarks normally bookmark manager would different would make mental separation tasks browsing bookmarks editing bookmarks since options right ve observed people mostly use plain sight bookmarks menu elements require additional steps access sidebar bookmark manager comment kenneth pst odds sort name option context menu would considered one way too much categories know would incredible convenience organization freak absolutely hate everything chronilogically organized comment jason bassford pst odds sort name option context menu since would n t writing code ca n t say n t really know easiest approach n t bookmarks dropdown menus appear order bookmark manager d find confusing presented different ways depending answer questions specifically would assume whatever sorting methods available within bm could hooked context menus without much difficulty could simply link bm context menus could thing comment ren chucker kuklau gone pst comment peter lairo comment luckily currently possible rename delete folder foo context menu know folder bum andreas jason believe misunderstand real problem obviously normal bookmark bookmark folder exactly context menu bookmarks manager non top level bookmark bookmark folder though already menu context menu would menu top another menu n t quite ugly may work right many operating systems s also confusing contextual menus menu items implemented ago phoenix project really hope actual usage considered every time someone believes s needed comment jason bassford pst non top level bookmark bookmark folder though already menu m trying say bug n t concerning non bookmark menu items anything bookmark item behave bookmark manager anything n t addressed related bug one specifically perhaps s also additional confusion n t use personal toolbar

sends unsent messages time gets new messages wo n t getting messages putting well outlook uses send receive purpose rather long instead suggest update updating local store getting messages waiting server updating server sending messages waiting unsent messages folder comment scottputterman pdt think get mail fine could change something like get news re really worried newsgroup m pretty sure update would confusing get msgs especially also sent messages different topic since brought n t think s intuitive make button also send unsent messages unless s preference button label also conveys

believe original point bug get msg new msg buttons similar esp original blue skin icons distinguished text labels similar english least making difficult quickly scan toolbar differentiate two buttons appear next n t see huge usability problem users learn quickly uses difference two buttons one far left x next one see value visually distinguishing two buttons since right next think improved modern icons help two icons look different original blue think word labels different helps also get mail problem news think changing get msg get msgs fine also get msg implies one hence create new message folks whereas get msgs implies multiple note users trouble button ones n t familiar concept request new messages expected new mail appear inbox changing new msg compose n t hugely semantically better

even bookmark deleted mozilla instances closed bookmark deleted last observation meant include unrelated issue deleted bookmark data still around reason included complete description hopefully important bug fixed say change bookmark property mean mozilla gui comment ben tells us bookmark url used key searching on manipulating bookmark data seems explain effects observed m right think

really used url unique identifier bookmarks database made fundamental error database design countless situations duplicates think bank index customer database using account balance unique identifier well s unlikely two people would ever exactly balance decision user allowed duplicate urls decision programmer taking left user fed forced things awkward way option left user select n t read bookmarks assign sequential unique id one n t need random generator saves much cpu re going storing ordering elsewhere anyway always use unique id internally hence bookmarks take form like duplicated like database meshing still work fine long designed well beginning say problems presumably someone thought well let s assume ll never get one url match designed system along lines please tell us s true

far logical solution mentioned simply give bookmark unique sequential id bookmark file read startup reindexing every time would n t take long d solve problem comment m_mozilla pdt favorite reason allowing multiple bookmarks put bookmark multiple keywords especially custom keyword queries type whichever way happen thinking something example isbn book might good keywords amazon com search

looking properties ll associate properties urls individual bookmark entries schedule notify entries definitely url specific info defintiely bookmark specific suggests ll end table urls bookmarks table

get new bugs appearing excessive checking urls updates possibly bookmark referencing url multiple notifications multiple alert boxes multiple windows opened changed url bug fixed said holds true might find need add properties dialog tab containing bookmarks reference url probably posted rfe comment ben bucksch benb pdt schedule notify entries definitely url specific maybe want schedules check hour workdays every hours weekend think problem multiple notification neglectable otherwise solvable comment thomas berg pdt n t think s worth try use url separate key object s url reality used address key information data example link page algorithms expressed rexx therefore bookmark s located map named rexx also bookmark map software use algorithm another language maybe map algorithms note example s information used also case page contains two independent informations case bookmarks removed one different needs notify url changed independently e g bookmark algorithms changed url pointing better example algorithm original page dissapeared bookmarks therefore removed redirected new url containing information relevent bookmark course use duplication url efforts enhance performance space

debugging qa aids etc period beta rtm perfect needs ed fix matt busy comment john morrison pdt need removed netscape rtm m sure following points would argue certainly removed debug builds although would require makefile munging developers use prefs uh debugging still need happen rtm e g hyatt asked something tonight requires disable xul cache yes could shut manually edit prefs js restart degree rarely touched netscape mozilla testers m sure need removed close rtm weeks prior mozilla org might never want remove long useful widely discussed yes realize blake big part mozilla org n t know answer question comment blake ross pdt yeah meant n t optimized builds said would require hackery d also forgotten debug pref panes yeah re right weeks long concern menus going removed like day rtm
