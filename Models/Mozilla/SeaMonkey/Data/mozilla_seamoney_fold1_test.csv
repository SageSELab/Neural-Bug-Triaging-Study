global preferences per account settings per identity settings admittedly think deeper kind preferences thinking want setting globally went something similar like label color settings view however say want kind settings though moment ca n t imagine use per whatever setting ll go ui well would interesting d give try remembering longish discussions ui features ve seen bugzilla think courageous enough come design m counting jennifer frank comment david bienvenu pdt frank yes first set questions think global setting way go surprisingly often people opinions completely odds mine fact view code access prefs makes reluctant add prefs code might right thing ui would like hear jennifer thinks global setting would probably go top level mail newsgroup general settings though prefs page pretty full m sure worth ui one things people feel strongly comment frank sch nheit pdt david correct m wrong n t nsmsgdbview already deal preferences already loads monitors preferences label colors seeing maybe

silly re right chose cache prefs service pointer label code n t s reason either re going ask prefs right comment frank sch nheit pdt ah yes caching pointer relict time read settings demand instead caching themself holds ensurepreferenceservice would needed anymore form change comment frank sch nheit pdt one thing m happy currently handling thisweek messages old commented well new code simply use difference system mail date less days week format used problem messages nearly one week ago instance monday read messages last monday date shown mon may suggest mail today people may tend look day mainly compare message date system date least usually stumble upon especially another mail nearby displayed mon personal taste enough distinguish always requires user aware current time wonder would make sense change thisweek condition example moday messages older instead hours formatted thisweek format comment david bienvenu pdt frank yeah today monday messages last monday show full date m quite sure time math comment m_mozilla pdt today monday messages last monday show full date m quite sure time math get current date get time last second current day get time one week prior last second current day call last thing cutoff seconds past epoch message timestamp cutoff use day week format else use full date format applies messages n t shown today yesterday type format today yesterday would work similarly going back hours last second today s date instead days back matt comment frank sch nheit pdt removing review keyword seems s something left comment m_mozilla pdt interest handling pathalogical cases either user message sender system clocks set incorrectly messages tomorrow say tomorrow show full date would confusing today monday messages six days ago say tuesday day week format messages tomorrow say tuesday also day week format know get mail folks time zone set wrong could see following making sense message older week end of day date format message age hours end of day today yesterday future message w in hours end of day tomorrow future message beyond hours end of day date format yes precise boundary conditions get idea matt comment frank sch nheit pdt s not now comment comment frank sch nheit pdt matt problem boundaries agree general idea limits think go implement way limits minus hours minus days like originally suggested bug like old code recent midnight recent midnight minus days however really like idea today yesterday somewhat strange tomorrow first omit time important information lost n t omit valueable space wasted screen second information got tomorrow sender configure client system correctly well think people want know s something see nearly equally easily date alone using tomorrow except s funny frank yes lot things mozilla s funny general like attitude case m sure comment frank sch nheit pdt created attachment details diff review preference dependent display format message date updated caching preference service pointer anymore week

code something like yyyymmddhhmm user host comment sarnold pst interested bug might also interested bug comment cls pst guess re either waiting documentation dawn re following bug s example comment dawn endico pst http www mozilla org build distribution html build docs official build means build gets put ftp site distributed many people could report bugs offical mean build created leaf build ids identifying build person used identifying milestone s one build given platform tell apart using build id like cyeh s suggestion changing perl scripts always insert development builds marking enhancement request adding helpwanted keyword reassigning back cls close n t like idea let sit around helpwanted bug comment cls pst created attachment details diff review always set buildid unless mozilla_official defined comment cls pst n t think want use buildid brand mozilla build sorta like idea adding user host buildid comment dawn endico pst yeah adding user host seems like might make easier keep track builds people using looking bug reports comment sean richardson pst ok understand wanting brand build dates cvs build get make sure build date invalid recent earlier code reasoning would suggest official builds milestones branded milestone number frozen code built actual build date time unreliable identifying age code quoting bug build ids cvs pull builds date additional comments granrose netscape com buildid tells us built n t necessarily imply source tree pulled really need know solution could add string updated per milestone used official builds like m appended build id half would amend instructions http www mozilla org quality bug writing guidelines html http www mozilla org quality help bug form html ask ask number available bug screeners qa people engineers tell tardy official build nightly binary comment cls pst well hit snag modified mozilla config aboutime pl add user host buildid problem however appears though xpinstall actually uses build id store registry course treat build id int probably change code ignore everything really want handle buildid meant merely informative date actually want visible official branding comment cls pst created attachment details diff review add prelim support strings buildid comment cls pst ok bypassed xpinstall problem using separate define nsbuildid h string default build id string set user host mozilla_official_string set build id set probably get someone xpinstall see s possible add build string registry well even want bother comment daniel veditz dveditz ooo jan pst also need sort pull id mostly agreed on user agent string supposed contain gecko sourcedate token sourcedate indicates files pulled understood anyway checked cbegle mozilla org ekrock netscape com way mozilla derivative comes two months polishing gecko date jibe mozilla community expects gecko actual product s build date useragent orthogonal discussion raise developer n t plan release anything pull date m concerned m trying track bugs would nice s showed builds posted patches windows cyeh n t like checking modified files problem pushing solution used checked in files template n t modify directly comment cls pst bug marked duplicate bug comment cls pst talking cbegle irc s fairly clear buildid mostly irrelevant useragent want concentrate still would like set default unless mozilla_official set alleviate user confusion cyeh reason build_number checked seems file generated local build currently force build id use force rule s already place means anything depends upon build_number nsbuildid h recompiled pass tree dveditz attach patches bug d like come equivalent unix builds comment asa dotzler asa pst bug marked duplicate bug comment chris yeh pdt mass re assign bugs listed qa contact comment andreas franke gone pdt problem misleading build id happened mozilla i pc linux gnu m mathml svg tar gz likely become fairly widespread also came across least one bug report recently someone specified wrong misleading build id although recent cvs pull caused irritation since seems patch available clear build id someone please check s perfect solution least better nothing comment daniel leaf nunes pdt ll take look fixing next week potentially removing checked file comment cls pdt checked fix unix builds causes build_number always set unless mozilla_official defined comment daniel roberts pdt yeah bug excellent example kind irritation false build id s andreas franke mentioned comment r k aa pdt d l ed build official ftp site mozilla i pc linux gnu tar gz build id long run could become little misleading well comment cls pdt really someone wants report bug buildid primary means identify build using hence setting non release buildids full path tarball downloaded would help buildid pull_id suggested dveditz would probably help m sure d comment r k aa pdt full path ftp mozilla org latest s good chance cause confusion removes comment cls pdt imo problem identifying builds ftp solved putting identifying string name tarball getting rid latest directory n t see current situation confusing previous one instead non sensical buildid caused lazy engineers checking code n t always build

precompiled mozilla ftp string since m seen binary wrong build id downloaded pretty much attempting help bugs found build id great help point reference ll ask people remember directory downloaded downloaded latest dir generate lot discussion back forth checking visited link ftp site etc etc lots work words n t need must idotic idea ve seen implemented project till goodbye bugzilla m outta comment jason eager pdt n t build id automatically generated client mk client side end every cvs pull build id become last time person pulled tree date time according gmt person s machine pdt necessary way ftp downloads date tree last pulled automatically stuff really bad comment david krause pdt mozilla nightly builds build id whoever builds nightlies leaf needs set mozilla_official

timeless pdt mozbot reliant latest make change harms m assigning bug comment cls pdt wow re really coming woodwork one maybe severity suspect nightly build script sets build_official replaced mozilla_official ifdef one checks comment daniel roberts pdt seems lot frustration sides issue let s face folks lose lose situation matter build id set client mk everytime mozilla pulled built takes forever build since re build everything build id hand thing done right people start complaining build id useless really stupid quarrel vote leave way get comment r k aa pdt another misleading build id bug reported regarding string bug since build id s seem back nightlies perhaps someone set wfm even fixed btw string commented upon several bugs short hours lasted seemed cause frustration amongst bug reporters well glad s back crawling back woodwork snuggle wiff da bugs comment daniel leaf nunes pdt chris mark fixed solution appropriate released builds ids comment jason eager pdt wait minute many

still win mac jce build id back nightlies number files affected directly numbers chrome depends nsbuildid h least files different libraries people still bugged use nightly gives us better chance narrowing problem anyways create official build using instructions http www mozilla org build distribution html n t really help us buildid still n t know exactly went build reassigning leaf win cc ing

automation leaf s staging scripts comment daniel leaf nunes pdt accepting windows dawn looks like setting mozilla_official build_official required get rid one though since mean thing comment jason eager pdt ll take look link making build official hack something local copy client mk automatically generate build id cvs builds asked number files affects mainly see complaint taking forever rebuild true files libraries unless one libraries libraptorhtml so n t think takes long rebuild comment daniel roberts pdt anything goes beyond meaningful changes takes long imho make minor change something tree example n t want re build extra files libraries test liners time want liners take seconds extra minute someone else pointed making build official simply degrade meaning qa folks since way

explaining understanding reduce confusion ll call merged folder view hood tb continues track folder account separately view merges unifies folders based like names every inbox gets displayed merged together one likely require separate layer merges fly could get hairy folder family accounta well accountc would see single family folder unified view want keep folders seperate name uniquely n t use unified view individual emails remain original locations migrated anywhere infact could even pivot link along side accounts labeled merged folder view somebody prefers browse way could pivot open

unsent messages use mean drafts folder closest header drafts messages x identity key id m driving see useful header going helping users filter messages part discussion users want able funnel messages one visible inbox still able separate purpose internal key user friendly would much rather see account name since s handle user account without digging prefs js s clear would help much since internal key useful processing purposes would think two headers added x account key x account name m calling account name called account settings ui prefs js seems like server name sorry message confused s m confused hope straighten bit thanks patience tackling long suffering problem comment jeremy morton pdt david patch redirecting mail one existing inbox existing tree name existing account new local

redirect mail anywhere unless set pref set pref redirect pop local folders account local folders account always exists guess s going end common way configure feature redirecting pop servers mail local folders account use x account key s unique identifier account possible us go account key account name display ui decide s good idea account name pretty name guaranteed unique ca n t use filtering header since still per server filters global filters n t need filter header makes sense might useful search could probably add new filter criteria original account could pick account drop know account key underneath d use account key comment len weisberg pdt thanks reply wrote filtering header since still per server filters global filters n t need filter header makes sense sorry n t understand mean saying even though messages deferred to account filtering would done based original account seems mysterious awkward btw message filters screen filters drop down entry local folders filter ui present original account name user translate internally account key sounds like good idea n t think s simplest best solution one thing point search may different matter also possible account key could change user shuffles accounts around perhaps moves mailbox one profile another still think straightforward x original account name header would useful simpler user deal course would addition x account key needed internal processing purposes n t think non uniqueness account name would problem user s purposes documented accounts deferred filtered way need distinct names s natural way setting anyway really think header provided need n t bother fancy filter translation notice sneaked name change proposed header x account name matter x account key seem ambiguous since two accounts picture btw much like implementation s all or nothing folders combined others kept separate comment map get complicated comment settolo pdt really really thanks taking bug working like way going implemented would like know patches work also tb included weekly precompiled release tb apply source code make test sorry english comment david bienvenu pdt yes currently filtering based original incoming server think

capitalist point of view advertisements offer useful value consumers course would take issue contention applied real world advertisements bottom line utility particular advertisement always subjective

ok understand even think know problem fix way testing make fix send changed source file able rebuild browser test s m sure happening server generated login forms i e forms content served back server store single signon database actual field names along value user entered store url well user returns url compare field names form field names database url fill corresponding saved values browser generated forms http authentication form field names make arbitrary names username field password field unfortunately arbitrary field names chose username password store way along url visited happen real field name url value username oops see dutifully fill saved value fieldname several possible fixes come mind one would make contrived fieldname something unlikely chosen real field name n t eliminate problem reduces probability occuring another fix would tag urls indicate whether correspond browser generated forms server generated ones prefilling would never prefill data saved one type form type form s probably easiest solution also foolproof comment simon lindsay pst sounds like ve got spot problem one twist though thought might involved reading reply field names part page consists two frames buttons left frame modify user add user etc right hand frame username getting replaced info dictated buttons appears main url address bar n t change url frames change isnt shown dictated buttons may add complexity solution yet download build mozilla sources keep trying linux windows new milestone snapshots hard build linux box guess d give go alternatively try fix snapshots would easier comment stephen p morse pst multiple frames worms heuristic use url common frames page field names knew field names repeated different frames heuristic would fail n t really trying get right cases figured would get right time practical fact problem encountering page could chaulked heuristic reliable since fix seems like s difficult might well put raise probability success heuristic sure could test nightly builds s fact tight tree control much easier check something demonstrate fixes problem checkin ca n t rig things basic testing comment stephen p morse pst bug marked duplicate bug comment stephen p morse pst although ca n t reproduce bug happens inside firewall understand would happening indeed bug ll confirm accept comment stephen p morse pst nominating beta per jar s recommendation used basis attack specifically malicious website could intentionally put form fieldname username and or password comment stephen p morse pst fix bug worked jar follows pseudo fieldnames used browser generated logins username password fieldname html form contains backslash character escaped pair backslash characters stored single signon database guarentees never confusion fieldnames html form ones browser generated dialog comment phil peterson pst pdt w b minus comment stephen p morse pst fix checked files involved singsign cpp wallet cpp although testing make sure change worked expected could test see really fixed original problem reported reason site demonstrated problem inside reporter s firewall would appreciated reporter either bug simon iweb net au reporter duplicate bug could test appear installed bits tomorrow march comment stephen p morse pst added kanej cc list s he reporter duplicate bug offered test fix gets checked comment simon lindsay pst excellent ll check tomorrow comment sairuh rarely reading bugmail pst okay since m able properly test ve reassigned qa contact steve simon kanej could post whether fix works d great steve verify bug thx much comment jkane pst downloaded latest nightly build trouble accessing site keep getting js errors n t cause problems nn ie time hit ok dialogue crashes mozilla app using win way problem shut js got point needed continue hitting ok preferences dialogue crashed app however got point noted login name inserted field set search users administrator need assign temporary id password view page see s happening would short period time window accessibility would small comment sairuh rarely reading bugmail pst sure would n t mind testing end give temp username password ll last day two also could please provide url page bug still problem guess might ve pulled build n t fix yet could tell us build id ie name directory downloaded bits thx comment stephen p morse pst d also like temp id password although sarah could test see worked would n t able track cause problem n t work comment jkane pst build id url page http sodexhosatisfaction tteam com test login first name theuser last name thepass password also thepass logged js error may give problems get without js click link proceed top blue frame gotten logged frame several drop down fields click database administration link think s link text s similar exactly able get first db admin page without js first time ll see bug search user fields blank administrator search among users get past js error problem click show users click edit box people listed instead user s name filling resulting text entry fields theuser thepass fill given user s info hope helps nail far js bug know js weird site ve sorts weird things get nn recognize calls forms etc easy whatever get nn recognize oh well comment sairuh rarely reading bugmail pst aha methinks see mean testing recipe using optimized commercial bits linux though n t think platform matters steps went http sodexhosatisfaction tteam com test logged instructed theuser firstname thepass lastname password clicked login button got following js error javascript error typeerror redeclaration const self url http sodexhosatisfaction tteam com test docselect cfm usercode userfirstname theuser userlastname thepass line number visit page another browser n t see similar error may indicate site yet updated support standards implemented mozilla browser w c document object model dom please see http developer netsape com mozilla information clicked database administration link left frame result right frame first name field contains theuser last name field contains thepass presume fields really blank since n t used signing right click display users link get table users click edit button result see kanej sees theuser thepass filled n t eww comment sairuh rarely reading bugmail pst looks like n t fixed gon na reopen comment jkane pst away day tomorrow upon return friday check progress disabling username password attempt away js bug friday huge impediment appears n t hope get figured comment stephen p morse pst problem thought note described scenerio first http authentication field names content fieldnames made http authentication dialog never contradicted http authentication although fixed potential problem fix problem login via html frame going another html frame url frames happen identical field names forms specifically userfirstname userlastname since store single signon values associated fieldname url look like field prefill solve immediate problem simply chosing different field names different forms realize desirable solution run problem urls already dup report barring solution easy knew implemented single signon would able catch cases particular using multiple frames url even using multiple forms within frame sharing field names foil heuristic hoped would infrequent case unfortunately hit infrequent case single signon implemented suitable page could mark wont fix since original design meant accurate could modify design non trivial way namely could store form frame information well require much thought certainly something s going done beta probably beta either ll push m maybe ll solution comment jkane pst right caught said http authenticated however missed said sorry confusion may make suggestion programmer keeping progress mozilla web developer interested finally able use current standards sure proposing reasonable sounds like simple fix case user data wrongly auto filled login name value yadda yadda associated field would make wense make auto fill first determine value associated form field give priorty value value value empty string auto fill s way field reasonable granted case search users field would help value associated reason way form field names users considered equal sign db tells page whether allow administration access users sign use userfirstname userlastname search fields like use name since coldfusion standards name form field nameas database column name winds thanks hope helps comment jkane pst may make another suggestion one would cover auto fill problems relate bug think login helper made fill username password site form question contains input type password way seach box later different form contains fieldname login form would fill info password field exists form meaning s clearly login form another goofy idea comment stephen p morse pst first idea prefilling content specifies initial value good one ll probably implement second idea prefilling password field sounds like good fact initially intended unfortunately notified dom one field time n t see entire form time need pre filling ll relook see indeed way determine priori password exists prefilling see entire form time form submitted hence capture values password field comment jim roskind pst sorry come gone transitioning pdt comment stephen p morse pst ok tightened heuristic using suggestions kanej made namely longer prefill username passwords default value given html password field form thought going possible upon looking code realized wrong changes place particular sites described bug report duplicate report functioning properly admittedly still cases heuristic fail probability failure much lower low plan getting therefore m going close report changes made nswalletservice cpp kanej verify fixed q a folks wo n t able access site comment jkane pst happy say works perfectly purposes least fact previous js errors n t seem problem anymore either thanks good job comment stephen p morse pst using kanej s comment closing verified comment jkane pst downloaded tested kicks latest nightly build mozilla b b build bug back gives comment stephen p morse pst n t know answer nothing changed area since last reported working ll need temporary account system order diagnose fix problem also provide detailed set steps symptoms observing comment jkane pst url sodexhosatisfaction tteam com test userfirstname demo userlastname demo password password login select database administration see demo first last name search fields well individual user edit screens comment stephen p morse pst sorry using demo login set n t see problem words works for me tried fresh profile tree ll pull fresh tree later tonight try tree comment jkane pst well tried new profile suggested seems work fine thing using mozprofile first time ever used strangely though erasing folder works fine guess anomoly sorry raising dead issue comment stephen p morse pst thanks reporting back working wo n t bother retesting

one compile top level cvs co extensions typeaheadfind cd extensions typeaheadfind make equivalent using gmake s needed linux xpi updated morning aaron s changes comment comment peter trudelle pdt cool feature configured search urls default n t people usually searching occurrence search string search lot n t think ever wanted restrict search url text wierd way seems like restricting search way exception case requiring extra effort invoke really needs supported norm comment johnny stenback jst jst mozilla com pdt ease navigation wanting use mouse least s thought find useful find kind text n t use shortcut find use quickly focus link load knows maybe m one s weird comment peter trudelle pdt well original report incremental text search through page mention links navigation comment akkana peck pdt m peter want find normal text well links also want stop forgetting selection position i e timeout pause seconds still able continue search obviously opinions sides ll need figure majority users would prefer mouseless disabled users probably prefer current setting links re average users probably used fiddling prefs rather accepting defaults comment mike gebis pdt even re search links camp seems time search text behavior inconvenient text re searching link also document non link n t seem like common case example bugzilla page seems links would found equally quickly even searching text additionally matches mental model make search links action requires modifier key m going search modified text makes sense need indicate somehow way things want search normal text requires hit special key maybe s fact past decade emacs like behavior become hardwired brain m clearly going search text camp s found bug first place comment akkana peck pdt minor irritating bug current code focus input type file character typed go input also go page instance click create new attachment type characters filename field get lots failed search beeps type move focus next text field description type normally beeps perhaps input type file n t preventbubble comment kyle yuan pdt cool feature like comments following two settings miss every time quit mozilla user_pref accessibility typeaheadfind true user_pref accessibility typeaheadfind linksonly true linksonly true typing letters n t find normal text ctrl g also prefer make finding text default setting use shortcut key toggle setting prefer find previous find backward function comment hixie reading bugmail pdt note think prefs called extensions typeaheadfind accessibility typeaheadfind ve problems getting work need spend time looking complaining comment hixie reading bugmail pdt d forgotten wipe component reg bad yeah comments would make full search default link search give us status bar feedback per comment otherwise looks good comment aaron leventhal pdt great created different prefs hopes getting discussion going feature m really interested know many non emacs users want text default users emacs users imho emacs users technically savvy enough change pref think end user testing would show people prefer linksonly true practice often end text m trying go link m proven wrong ll gladly change basis emacs users want old feature different application also n t want get legalistic argument whether implementing superset original rfe appropriate text search available pressing text rfe implemented status line think status messages n t show running branch based builds trunk based builds lot things wo n t doable via xpi ll require patches core code m also happy status messages yet still show target url link s landed parenthesis s little bit harder sounds s done via onoverlink nswebshell cpp http lxr mozilla org seamonkey source docshell base nswebshell cpp going find previous perhaps via accel shift g think keystroke mean find backwards normal find collapsing selection timeout turned bad idea would also nice show selection special somehow perhaps box drawn around selection disappears type ahead find mode ends selection text would still highlighted response comments motivation timeout found rather incovenient distracting since action cancels find seems unnecessary m sure people think second default timeout short set timeout pref gets rid timeout completely typed characters n t match ignored different apps little disorienting m used typing backspace enter character n t match deletes last character match n t necessarily wrong different expecting n t mind changing s pretty minor detail view see point kyle following two settings miss every time quit mozilla kyle n t understand question comment ken harris pdt take still n t work mac m sure m person mac d love play ca n t figure build mozilla mac surely somebody netscape mozilla build configured mac would simple matter compile comment alexander schulze pdt never used emacs still think feature rocks imo whole text search without quotation mark either standard least option find bit disorienting type enter letters ve never seen program works way think creating pref would best solution concerning timeout also lack see motivation since switch think s problem s feature n t hurt anyone want activate comment arthur pdt ve used emacs never incremental search ll try never search links page often words text snippets vote searching whole text default links option comment mike gebis pdt curiosity people prefer search links also think regular old find page dialog links option comment hixie reading bugmail pdt build xpi based get status bar feedback mandrake http www internet masters com ao nanos ac html search wrangle find page n t scroll incrementally searched match google though comment jesse ruderman pdt think scrolls finds text link re using typeaheadfind navigation feature linksonly wo n t notice bug re using quick way search comment m_mozilla pdt background m used feature text editor mua searches text understandably m hopefull default search text also generally wish could use normal find page search generally feature useful ve landed page search engine query need find relevant text may large page vote defaulting search text understand link navigation handy feature probably would n t use would glad know users need want efficient keyboard means navigating links hmmm actually could prefix typeing special character thing search links d probably give shot maybe even grow like suggestion request implmented way universally available ideally could use code mail news composer well matt comment hixie reading bugmail pdt yes scrolling links ve found another big bug incremental search thing disabled message pane mail news otherwise n b etc shortcuts n t work anymore comment aaron leventhal pdt m really surprised many people bug prefer text search wonder s techie thing whether users feel way really nice thing link search link automatically focused type first letters link press enter re much speedier using mouse navigate links m time rather finding text accel f still available maybe done work bug instead suggestion request implmented way universally available ideally could use code mail news composer well work implemented content area benefit including embedded browsers using gecko however hixie says may disable mailnews content pane bad comment arthur pdt strange would see search links beeing targeted towards techies whole text search keyboard only browsing seems techie thing s easy discover navigate without help context menues like disappointed great work easily either configurable via preferences even accesible via two different ways features available promise look closer idea keyboard surfing ve figured open link new windows tab via ctrl alt return s must keyboard browsing comment m_mozilla pdt may disable mailnews content pane frankly d prefer disabled default everywhere ideally d like hit keycommand start isearch type text hit enter find next occurances type escape click anywhere get isearch ll happy sort isearch keyboard only browsing seems techie thing d agree however m accustomed using mouse n t yet miss keyboard navigation links m also accustomed isearch like functionality text editor mua much miss full text isearch mozilla many apps m often using google s cached pages weak substitute help find page hits landed hilighting feature m using google m using normal find page feature wish worked isearch fashion matt comment pedro lopes pdt think problem using one interface two unrelated features quick keyboard navigation links b incremental find making pref circunvents problem could better since really different features give different interfaces link navigation remains since search mode entered implicitly typing wo n t work mail composer noted previous comments feature n t think problem convenience worth incremental find entered

edit find presses cmd g maybe cmd shift g search backwards addition selecting text text part link link gets dotted outline thingy pressing return enter follows link m done searching choose edit hide interactive find menuitem name changed press cmd shift f escape taken right toolbar disappears focus back web page scroll up down arrows come think up down still scroll page isearch used since bar

ways could see working could either pop started using one incremental find type ahead link find text field could always could even label like fi_n_d would discoverable alt n would start find could even checkbox x _l_inks would also discoverable alt l would toggle state course screen real estate seems problem comment akkana peck pdt like feedback status bar n t take extra real estate though

keyboard shortcuts believe interactive find category changing conflicting binding mail news prove problem quick look gives available letter shortcuts mail news plus accel letter accel shift letter besides s like accel shift f readily identifies operation called search messages anyway s ll shut keyboard shortcuts comment ken harris pdt ok going sound really smart really stupid somewere always

see bug comment comment geoffrey borggaard pdt first wow ve using typeahead find since s first inception love ca n t count times ve stuck front internet explorer start typing scratch head s working anyway typeahead find browse use rodent really annoys said think still plenty room improvement ve seen comments reverse search really like feature emacs see reason ca n t implemented right ctrl g find next think would really cool ctrl shift g find next backwards second feature would really like see ability use typeahead find select buttons happened would almost reason left use mouse perhaps another prefix character like would mean select input items perhaps new paradigm used input controls consider load page bunch text reason m page form need fill somewhere like logon form search box old off line world filling forms easy hit tab shift tab jump elements form still today often need get form first requires mouse tab key cycle far many links widgets first couple ideas assign key find next input element bage one go back last input element page similar tab shift tab line world assume cursor within form tab shift tab sufficient navigate around form therefore key jump first input element first form would really helpfull hitting key skip first input element next form etc ideas keep great work revolutionized way especially speed browse web thank comment adam katz pdt geoffrey comment

quote press accel shift g shift f find previous current string ve typed others suggesting ways _initial_ search backwards reverse way previous next point repeat search comment david pdt release notes said post rfes someone might already mentioned n t want read previous entries think big mistake start links search default whenever key typed ought specific search command key type first like find

benefit kind direct access keyboard example d really love able type g go type url without transfer focus location bar d like able bind search google search whatever text type type ahead find mechanism much potential even emacs isearch requires type ctrl s initiate search n t mess things starting searches default please david flanagan comment travis hume pdt absolutely agree david flanagan s comment type ahead find great feature causes problems end ctrl l focusing address bar often use ctrl l goto address type ahead find stealing keystrokes search page used able work around pressing ctrl tab happened super lame ctrl tab switches tabs ruined d much prefer option require either pressed type ahead find would activated hope makes sense comment aaron leventhal pdt m considering perhaps typeaheadfind require keystroke start however n t understand could interfere accel l focus location bar shouldnt affect comment owen marshall reading bugmail pdt filed rfe bug adding perf type ahead comment adam katz pdt also think isearching require initiating keystroke typeaheadfind really useful feature mentioned last comments using keystrokes limits future keyboard based enhancements refer comment argues shortcuts similar less man pages vim search search links reverse search reverse search links n find next n find previous f page b page g top g bottom j one line k one line h left l

rather shortcut icon imo author s html n t able start changing parts ua interface willy nilly using one icon consistently may nice convenience even useful saw different widgets simultaneously change distinct icons response user would probably gaaah invaded machine n t think anyone suggested yet ie icon could also used saving desktop file link shortcut case mac perhaps badged onto standard document icon however os handles sort thing far size image use anything work long author knows may scaled scaled differently different widgets skins image type anything mozilla render work someone wants add support ico files power mozilla comment braden pst tim agree alternate think mistaken context comment simply countering mpt s assertion specifying rel attribute consisting one word implies current document two equally valid relationships linked resource simply incorrect matter fact alternate act modifier rather distinct relationship reason relationship type modifiers could introduced future fact microsoft introduced shortcut modifier icon coupling two de facto standard meaning find mpt s objections shortcut modifier wholly unconvincing ve already countered one addressed arguments say html authors n t able arbitarily modify client ui agree supposing microsoft someone introduced additional modifiers supporting shortcut modifier means implies would support hypothetical additional modifiers well otoh say icon could also used saving desktop file link shortcut s entirely possible suppose someone wanted use different icon use bookmarks entry well kind situation exactly modifiers comment tim larson pst braden http www w org tr rec html types html h nowhere states implies behavior alternate links required _may_ room interpretation counter argument imo merit description alternate type says designates substitute versions document link occurs goes explain used alternate language media versions page place see alternate used modifier description stylesheet seems

modifier alt stylesheet similar used instead case want different types icons create new link type icon shortcut icon desktop icon etc modifiers create ambiguity spec address general sense know handled

making www netscape jp default japanese homepage still belong string bundles comment tao pdt hi alec concern creating locale sensitive profile default prefs values derived js all js defaults pref targeting switching preferences values per locale suggested let know clarify thanks comment alec flett pdt referring think s wrong think place storing locale sensitive data default prefs files like all js simply incorrect fix code use string bundles instead comment tao pdt preference values modifiable runtime resources managed stringbundles propose leaving all js others defaults pref

completely alec localized prefs evil put data string bundles code set determine pref exists use get string bundle value user ever explicitly changes save pref comment alec flett pdt d like know localizable string need set runtime feeling time s misuse prefs changing value never changed user seems like appropriate solution would put blank string prefs code calls getunicharpref gets blank

pref window s kind point seperate chrome directories component n t worry collision designed mailnews js ns mailnews js system purpose collision comment tao pdt meant mailnews js mailnews ns js pref

earlier migth put pref defaults properties ui components one single package chrome regional locale pref defaults nav properties chrome regional locale pref defaults mailnews properties chrome regional locale pref defaults editor properties urls separated rest localizable resources anyway depends much pr btw planning merge config js all js since one pref config js would survive remove obsolete ones anyone s plate moving urls pref defaults clean pref files comments objections taker comment daniel veditz dveditz ooo jan pdt fair number localizable prefs appear kind thing need open first window
