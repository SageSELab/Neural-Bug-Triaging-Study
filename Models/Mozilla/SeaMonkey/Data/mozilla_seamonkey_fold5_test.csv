worst could say already windows xp netscape office v x toast products would amazing job m sure icons amazing quality creativity os x outstanding m fan n t noticed comment jeremy morton pdt created attachment details jez s proposed icon use mozilla associated document filetypes comment jeremy morton pdt ve attached ico file containing icons designed use document filetypes associated mozilla m aware deal stuff images happen use another program deal person said s nothing worse able tell gif jpeg tell apart icon nearly every image file shell set show file extensions seperate icons different image types would bug anyhow icon submitted would intended associated document filetypes dealt mozilla hence s kind piece paper dinosaur head ve associated relevant filetypes machine eg htm html xml frankly think looks pretty cool ico contains icons x x x pixels size color true color versions s point including color versions windows n t differentiate true color dunno sorry s ico n t tools create anything advanced could possibly make default icon document based filetypes mozilla supports mozilla associated like better mozilla exe icon differentiates documents mozilla comment skewer pdt ve attached ico file containing icons designed use document filetypes associated mozilla m aware deal stuff images happen use another program deal like icon coming winxp user course icon would somewhat inappropriate os say though n t look like put effort making color icons horrible person said s nothing worse able tell gif jpeg tell apart icon nearly every image file shell set show file extensions seperate icons different image types would bug s good workaround proper way file extensions hidden end user windows environment least since ie associated gif jpeg used green gif red jpeg windows xp uses shapes icon sunset photo forest photo distinguish formats forget icon goes format currently sunset jpeg s photo red forest png s photo red shapes gif gif useful type basic image good file association file association allows know file s extension without actually seeing extension tell zip winzip icon xml ie s world icon one favorite intuitive icons text file notepad icon able recognize whether image gif jpeg png icon one could get used extensions disappointing environment formats icon paint shop pro photoshop uses tiny text distinguish formats also poor design course wo n t make large fuss mozilla image format icons m never going assign formats mozilla ll assign much capable image editing program right associate psp ve overridden psp icon winxp default icons described anyway think icon submitted would good enough html documents would use files ending html shtml phtml xhtml anything else s different version html however need something intuitive css xml wait associate css seems like composer think xml something similar msie icon xml css something similar winxp ini icon currently use red color good theme stick think bent corner page lizard bad things get attached s important icons represent file format well comment jeremy morton pdt like icon coming winxp user course icon would somewhat inappropriate os say though n t look like put effort making color icons horrible huh n t make sense like color icons spent time making look acceptable think re ok frankly would look good color person said s nothing worse able tell gif jpeg tell apart icon nearly every image file shell set show file extensions seperate icons different image types would bug s good workaround proper way file extensions hidden end user windows environment least since ie associated gif jpeg used green gif red jpeg windows xp uses shapes icon sunset photo forest photo distinguish formats ok totally different way identifying file types like icon identify program going open file identify actual filetype extension m using system file extensions disabled go slowly mad want see full filename damnit besides image files s usually quite obvious filetype context eg website images likely gif family photos likely jpeg re opening things n t really matter format long image handling program supports matters program open end like every file associated particular program icon therefore think xml every filetype mozilla deals icon associated really need different icons different filetypes manually associate think bent corner page lizard bad things get attached s important icons represent file format well disagree see xml icon ie uses must admit rarely work xml files n t seen makes think non ie program open think d manually change standard ie handled file icon comment michael newton pdt personally use file extensions use fb moz view images fact n t even think associate images s another matter fact windows looking folder hundreds icons list view files tend look extensions course comment correct ms wants appear like mac desktop file extensions software products made os try fit look feel os brings mind another argument icons mac see advantages corporate giants like ms probably pay guy year sit cubicle draw icons comment robert accettura raccettura pdt ms used iconfactory design icons windowsxp comment skewer pdt jm appears issue personal preference however think majority users prefer method suggested require displaying file extensions identifying program opens file obvious person operates computer program opens file told program associate format program steals formats without permission excepted course red theme consistently throughout icons enough identify mozilla program opens file furthermore least winxp want use specific program open file use open menu bare minimum would making big mistake use one icon html xml image formats least need separate html xml images re completely different types data say formats use icon defiles whole purpose icons first place oh problem color icons appear converted true color win icons example true mastery color iconography mostly mixing colors evenly alternating pixels two different colors keep making icons like though could probably touch color versions comment skewer pdt created attachment details updated document icon w color xp formats added winxp format icons transparent drop shadow redid color icons lizard ca n t look good colors went instead think small icon best color icons made anyone using low color display would stupid use size like x m worried one s perfect comment skewer pdt created attachment details viewable using browser interesting file extension ico mime type image x icon seem convey information file s format oh well mistake mistake becomes common practice comment jeremy morton pdt appears issue personal preference however think majority users prefer method suggested require displaying file extensions probably right although really wish ms apple n t dumbed computing way relying icon identify filetype terrible idea identifying program opens file obvious person operates computer program opens file told program associate format hmm many diffent file handler programs might forget personally folder hundreds different files n t want hundreds different icons icons tell quickly _program_ open file want different ones preferably examine actual filename filetype said personal preference m sure mozilla deal differing views maybe give option mozilla customize icons different filetypes although would rather defeat purpose icons re meant assigned automatically making easier user idenfity mozilla handled files say formats use icon defiles whole purpose icons first place sorry disagree re using icons identify program opens file n t oh problem color icons appear converted true color win icons example true mastery color iconography heh really go color mode everything looks distinctly horrible thought color icons actually looked better average color icons programs n t even color icons added winxp format icons transparent drop shadow redid color icons lizard ca n t look good colors went instead put think icon looks better olive green vile larger m icons look slightly better barely readable small m ve always thought italicised m boring unimaginative anyway ca n t stay consistent use dinosaur color mode think get look least acceptable also color reduction color kept light dark fade paper using white grey dithering n t look nicer plain grey paper like windows xp icons though let s keep transparent drop shadow microangelo n t seem give option comment jos jeria pdt offense say icon set http grayrest com moz resources icons shtml still far better proffesional icons presented also match existing window icons well comment malcolm scott pdt add opinion firstly n t like document icons grayrest com include extension icon see however could adapted improved issues far see extensions icons afaik program puts file extension within icon s icons want see file extension look bit look filename assuming disabled hiding extensions one icon vs icon file type vs icon group file types agree jeremy morton many different icons confusing want see program open file also end users n t really care s front png image care s image also think folder e g html document associated images easy spot html file without look file extensions remember default winxp etc hide file extensions original point bug s suggestion use sort page icon easily associated mozilla e g top right icon grayrest s set jeremy s skewer s red page icon minus lizard possibly addition pale semi transparent lizard like watermark page various overlays depending sort file user dealing suggest following icons image png gif jpg e g paintbrush page html htm html xhtml e g jeremy s lizard on page script js xul css e g cogwheel page xml xml sure one link url html icon shortcut arrow sound comment jeremy morton pdt offense say icon set http grayrest com moz resources icons shtml still far better proffesional icons presented think mine look lot better ones left ok really appropriate files dealt mozilla ones right nasty also use boring unimaginative italicised m reminds lot netscape s n throbber criticised much let s make mozilla look good use dinosaur one icon vs icon file type vs icon group file types think ll agree compromise option icon different groups filetypes would n t mozilla associated image files d easily spot html file load image files suppose d want different icons different group types think icon paper sensible compromise default icons least d like add personal experience icons pretty much limited windows ve seen requests huge icons x supposedly mac supports really reason create icons sizes x x x windows ll specifying submitted icons specifically windows icons thank god m using mac comment jeremy morton pdt created attachment details windows blank mozilla icon created blank windows mozilla icon nice base work adding stuff top represent certain group filetype ve made color versions best dither get think looks better all grey piece paper ve worked windows xp alpha shadow ve put windows xp versions icons removed shadow versions alpha transparency ca n t achieved shadow may wrong color icon looks ok without shadow comment jeremy morton pdt created attachment details windows watermark mozilla icon idea mozilla watermark icon interesting one created watermark icons see although looks rather gorgeous x version icon n t work x version ca n t get dinosaur head small enough fit look like dinosaur head

really good reason watermark idea suddenly seems feasible comment malcolm scott pdt considering many programs n t colour icons people using colour mode surely expect things look foul anyway could make

keep watermark place higher colour depths comment alex hosking pdt ems b million one atchments check something eben sucks always change later comment jeremy morton pdt comment yep seems like

comment skewer pdt brian ve forgotten purpose bug re read description different shell icons identify associated file type none owners marked wontfix s safe assume side effects fixing bug worth please stop regurgitating opposition bug besides ve already proven msdn document need create different icons different formats re making icons bmp ico svg anything stupid like re going textually put extension icon n t talking like bare minimum re going need html xml image icons tell three types apart re different enough s easy justify giving icons jpeg png would bad us use icon image need design icons two formats paintbrush mixed feelings icon x distinct recognizable tbh x looks like joint paintbrush think one ought scrapped future design x work way people use x icons n t mean much icon looks really good size comment jeremy morton pdt bare minimum re going need html xml image icons tell three types apart different icons html xml xml stands extensible markup language html on drugs re similar warrant seperate icons say leave mozilla head leave users see file s extension care much paintbrush mixed feelings icon x distinct recognizable agreed m working palette icon right s looking much promising suggest overlays icons roughly square shape scaled effectively future design x work way people use x icons n t mean much icon looks really good size s perfectly possible find overlays icons look good sizes think make look good sizes s much easier start big icon scale start small scale try adding detail image starting x n t good idea find overlays scaled well comment skewer pdt different icons html xml xml stands extensible markup language html on drugs re similar warrant seperate icons say leave mozilla head leave users see file s extension care much sounds like n t know xml xml normally contain html tags similar html d say d correct make images use icon html make xml use icon html furthermore bug duped one bug titled different icons html xml files wanted comment jeremy morton pdt sounds like n t know xml xml normally contain html tags similar html d say d correct make images use icon html make xml use icon html ok html drugs bit simple metaphor however re markup languages re text documents re used help render information nicer better laid way re derivitaves standard sgml opinion warrant icon xml used used improve upon html make easier work often used much else please tell m world s greatest expert xml certainly comment jeremy morton pdt created attachment details windows blank mozilla icon template ve made watermark obsolete general consensus seems kiss comment brian netdragon bober pdt ve forgotten purpose bug re read description different shell icons identify associated file type depends definition file type bug n t say file extension says type handling images poor compared windows picture fax viewer acdsee n t warrant extra icons distribution extension hardly anyone going associate images mozilla explained want every extension icon n t seem necessary guess long png jpg jpeg gif n t go overboard wo n t complain worth follows behavior windows eventually made extensible add ons handle image formats could install additional association icons paintbrush icon good idea gifs usually graphic art perhaps keep simple show depiction picture jpegs shapes gif since usually drawn clue png since could d also personally like nothing protruded depiction document page unless mini application icon want paintbrush d stand upright contained within page drawing little something perspective could use pencil might easier depict x xml would look better x moved inside page extending outside bit unreadable x also would allow make document depiction larger allow fit html something like ______________ _______ ______ _______ _______ ________ _____ ________ ________ ________ _______________ depicts text floating around images use imagination would appropriate x looking icons microsoft uses increasingly warming idea red border since look cleaner without little dino head also gives room people use x icons n t mean much icon looks really good size size linux uses could convert x true color device image format linux uses keep cross platform consistancy also resolutions become higher people might start using often x also needs cleaning attachments someone mentioned making everything contained within red page give pixels work inside document image image pixels course would leave couple pixel columns open would n t look like page square believe consistancy one icon everything contained within document page depiction way every icon also noticed standard device images n t normally see assume color grey white page background ca n t use lighter red like true color images need change palette one color also think would good idea come common naming scheme icons something like imggif ico imgpng ico imgdefault ico docxml ico dochtml ico allows icon names reflect image type gif image type png document type xml etc also means consistancy different icons html xml signifiicantly different fact xul xhtml rdf files xml files different namespaces going different icons images different icons also also need default document icon perhaps page text re derivitaves standard sgml s bit misleading xml n t presentation language html sgml xul xml xul s icon would something graphical rdf would look better lines text x appropriate xml language real presentation s perfectly possible find overlays icons look good sizes agreed takes time patience artistic ability filed new bug creating art graphics component within marketing product bug hopefully get graphic artists head component make decisions mozilla graphics comment brian netdragon bober pdt created attachment details windows blank template except new color images color icons light red grey background need also include template icon source package distributions n t done giovanni s icons comment jeremy morton pdt d also personally like nothing protruded

little dino head also gives room dunno mean without little dino head overlaid dino head proposed icon standard mozilla filetypes size linux uses could convert x true color device image format linux uses keep cross platform consistancy also resolutions become higher people might start using often agreed x also needs cleaning attachments someone mentioned think look fine making everything

idea os hiding file format s os s fault icon n t replace task comment skewer pdt overlay either generates shadow generates shadow top page general effect supposed overlay floating page agree would difficult add effect icons point since many hand made single layer anyone wants try add shadows icons try actually prefer drop shadow eminate page overlay level think looks bit nicer shadows seem like overkill either xml icon others need amended get shadows normalized definitely say adding shadow x would look horrible x left flat nondimensional also image icon would look better as is s even much overlay objects page others could use drop shadow page nobody wants work s major issue probably way get drop shadow middle icons hand like work done n t think proposed icons look attractive os x os does will use hi rez icons even rendered hi rez look pretty bland odd people really use icons big seems like resolution super duper ultra xga would n t able fit folder document files onto screen icons large regardless icons done right windows ico format suggest anyone making icons different oses make icons appropriate shell suggestion would cleanly squeeze file name icon perhaps like photoshop bar

number users really n t like current behavior however also noticed decline number complaints sidebar generally rise number comments people find useful since ve always believed feature sidebar general something users see value getting familiar think makes sense netscape keep default though think blake s suggestion web searches good one i e types searches present results sidebar already open chrome

something easily point patch small tomorrow comment claudius gayle pdt current proposal actually sol n exact original reason bug filed matter says read summary mpt vs claudius back forth heart issue

proposal inconsistent pref open search tab sidebar search results available pref checked seems user would expect opened displayed already open consensus bug seems web search results shown sidebar

smoketest comment german pdt worried well samir said conceivable users acclimatized feature may want removed points since past opt out rather opt in many folks implicitly relying work would evil change behavior discovered lot users like side by side feature able access recent results even navigating away page based know recommendation change current behavior netscape sure mozilla remove

repeated user behavior comment peter trudelle pdt okay simple easy good explicit ll continue open sidebar display search results iff pref pref continue apply search whether chrome web page comment todd pringle pdt clear means pref turned back default netscape works comment samir gehani pdt ok blake discussed recommendations peter trudelle s comments came know m creating work work hopefully put issue bed concerns sidebar panel popping open annoying general blake gathered info netscape x user feedback mozillians voiced concern users search webpage n t expect browser pop open sidebar users may already expect search panels populated used feature previous release related convenient users use sidebar search panel results search initiated webpage well note populating search panel anything opening whatever make sure label next pref really expresses behavior implement users n t distinguish chrome webpage initiated searches let s make behaviors w r t search sidebar panel recommended solution change pref wording functionality open search tab sidebar search results available sidebar already open pref switch search panel iff sidebar already open pop open sidebar ever blake s earlier suggestion always populate search panel results chrome webpage initiated even sidebar closed or sidebar open search panel closed pref open search panel set false satisfying concerns sidebar n t pop open concerns satisfied results always populated concerns satisfied pref description honest concern satisfied search panel open pref chrome webpage initiated searches current behavior concern satisfied unless hear convincing argument otherwise alternate recommendation implement m coming patch comment blake ross pdt say n t understand would wanted default commercial builds proof people find behavior annoying proof widely liked feature people understand sidebar constantly popping open n t open search opens go back forward s obvious go digging preferences panel turn german s cursory usability testing bug reflect sentiment many posts beta feedback newsgroups cursory usability testing ns betas behavior inconclusive best like sidebar search feature also liked prompted sidebar results auto opening large number users though seemed intrusive similar popups looked d rather err non intrusive side tend side mpt auto opening default behavior especially true since usually beginners change default config ie closing sidebar thus respect deliberate user decision since nothing changed regard intrusiveness feature since ns betas curious yielded sudden change mind press mentions ve seen lauded idea showing results sidebar aspect causes sidebar force open web search results new usability studies showed majority tested either enjoyed feature understood turn d love see none mentioned anyways n t see opinions group off the street people valuable users submitted feedback users enough trouble getting rid sidebar continue work area adding x close button shortly fixed automatic snapping open sidebar resized small worked hard continue try clarify distinction collapsing sidebar via grippy closing sidebar via view sidebar x preference default blows distinction water german noted earlier year ignores specific user chosen preference sidebar closed many commented average user n t understand difference chrome searches web searches yet suggested user understands grippy collapses sidebar temporarily close easy reopening view sidebar x closes sidebar temporarily web search search pref view sidebar x permanent indeed pref makes view sidebar x temporary setting believe samir s approach supersedes need smart ui requires user say multiple times learn making valid assumptions front user sidebar open search tab re searching s unreasonable assume re interested switching tab see results fact results still appear tab tab wo n t switched sidebar collapsed satiates desire keep feature opinion concerned discoverability could consider modifying approach pop open sidebar user collapsed action understood inherently temporary closed one thing plan samir outlined m sure agree populating tab results even sidebar closed generally allow services run background like samir closed mean collapsed n t think s even possible put results panel sidebar closed since panel n t exist unless done upon reopening panel current approach much privacy concern invasive far user concerned re reading search terms default even asked turn sidebar n t believe current usefulness search tab list search result titles description anything else outweighs evident cost intrusive feature

regarding comment simple adding onsecuritychange call onlocationchange call line xpfe global resources content bindings tabbrowser xml although needs done well security icon change tab besides first tab _just_ update switching tabs problem work ie going secure site th tab update icon switching unsecure tab secure tab would additionally go site mixed security www amazon com get warnings assuming n t disable course get browsing first tab tab code responsible generating warnings onstatechange handler found security manager boot src nssecurebrowseruiimpl cpp code responsible generating

particular tab s browser may occur tab viewed tab loaded background state changes passed listeners want time n t want miss security related things course nssecurebrowseruiimpl try update security icon inappropriately setting state directly via onsecuritychange another problem easily fixed though calling onsecuritychange browser rather changing icon directly onstatechange second problem

fullslowrefresh calls document getelementsbytagname link old method dorefresh identified head element scanned links within obviously new method slower mitigated fact gets called toolbar first enabled rather every pageload new method also catch link elements found outside head case document s html bad question whether increase coverage worth seems likely fullslowrefresh least short term called tabs switched bug also probably called first link enabled page encountered toolbar converted xbl bug perhaps optimized extent previous code really realistic cases link might encountered outside head acceptable cases link might appear toolbar initially disappear later say switch tabs switch back acceptable link might appear turn toolbar viewing page show hit reload okay well s brain dump instinct suggesting go old optimized lower coverage version opposite instinct said wrote patch ll sleep perhaps provide updated patch suggestions would much appreciated comment basic pst warning reviewer observation opinion mozilla currently cause link elements go first head element dom tree parsed via html parser goes xml parser xhtml link elements appear declared one declares head elements get dom well personally n t think link s outside first head elements supported case w html standard n t allow speeds better otoh mozilla currently seem restriction elements work contained head element xhtml parsed via xml parser html parser matter stuffs everything head questions site navigation toolbar work xhtml bug depend way round depend block relationship latest patch supersedes hyatt s patch right comment stuart ballard pst answers questions n t specifically tested xhtml know reason n t work dom functions used cases s direct depend block relationship bug convert link toolbar xbl bug primarily applies startup new window time bug covers pageload time however bugs operate code much code touched patch also touched patch appears xbl giving problems moment think patch worth checking meantime gives improvement logic changes still need incorporated bug patch written hyatt s patch checked time ago patch depends patch c level provides necessary event firing patch consumes event acts accordingly full effect patch also need another c level patch one fires head tag encountered explicitly implicitly patch works fine without simply improve behavior event gets fired far scanning links concerned think agree non standard xhtml n t oxymoron small enough set pages wo n t worry ll produce updated patch fullslowrefresh optimized way dorefresh used comment stuart ballard pst created

quicksearch field may obvious enough ways return normal folder view performing quicksearch suggested reset button added quicksearch bar would clear entry field return normal folder view comment scottputterman pdt agree confirming comment jglick pdt suggest clear button left advanced button would remove text search field comment alex bishop pdt m sure users would understand clear n t remove search string also displays messages folder ideal button label would something like clear search text display messages folder s bit long vote reset comment jglick pdt reset sounds bit techy hardware ish think also full search dialog search messages uses clear probably consistent well robin thoughts comment alex bishop pdt reset sounds bit techy hardware ish think ok convinced clear gets vote users figure works first time use comment navin gupta pdt created attachment details diff review proposed fix comment navin gupta pdt fix add clear button reload folder tooltip reload folder disabled default gets enabled searchview disabled folder view comment navin gupta pdt jennifer like behavior clear button described comment alex bishop pdt m jennifer m particularly fond tooltip something along lines show messages folder would better comment ben ruppel pdt know m little late ll throw would show good button label would confuse people stuff hidden besides quicksearch comment scottputterman pdt m suggestions thrown think may problems clear reset clear implies results cleared s want pane want load folder also agree reset connotations jennifer says ll throw another one go folder search basically message selected would reload folder select message message n t selected would reload folder could also see reload folder show folder comment jglick pst ok rational clear robin thoughts appreciated technical stand point button reloading full contents current folder m sure average users understand happening guess users see feature search filter existing folder type something current folder searched matching results matches displayed want end reset clear cancel search get back started users points view really clearing search get back search criteria results cleared removed start fresh messages displayed tooltip d probably go along lines use something like clear search criteria comment ben ruppel pst problem search blank box n t expect show possible results expect error something n t enter term connection something never made maybe m old timer guess however winxp search thing shows files field clear mozilla subscribe pane newsgroups expected behavior mac linux searches n t much problem clear s m wondering new user would expect behavior comment robinf pst suggestions clear button text makes sense user tooltip clear search criteria show messages comment alex bishop pst tooltip clear search criteria show messages sounds good n t make decisions comment h kan waara pst idea keep ui clean usable possible make even visible feature filtering folder using string textbox make user understand therefore n t need confusing clear reset button think idea think wording could show messages whose subject sender contains makes especially apparent filter folder text proposed little longer specific current btw n t even correct english sentence subject sender contains blah textbox s gon na tiny bit smaller make text fit comments comment alex bishop pst think even wording revised still clear button make easy get back default view comment matthew paul thomas pst discussion tooltip text moot windows mac os control already permanent label push button tooltip anyway agree h kan please please please could mail news team start considering whether solve ui problems changing reducing ui already rather adding yet another alert case yet another button perhaps would n t many complaints n p m mail news bad ui case s even clear s problem clicking original folder clearing quicksearch field may obvious enough ways return normal folder view may obvious enough people wo n t use feature anyway current method obvious enough outlook express users n t obvious enough mozilla users users figure works first time use applies clear button ca n t apply text field first place indeed problem think could solved two simple changes making text field much shorter moment domination thread pane makes look compulsory n t removing advanced button makes look like submittable form cancel reset button n t comment h kan waara pst agree mpt goal make user interface easy use understand solution look elements think ok make simpler add ui fact adding ui opposite effect comment alex bishop pst discussion tooltip text moot windows mac os control already permanent label push button tooltip largely agree n t think tooltip would hurt physically painful way anyway may obvious enough people wo n t use feature anyway current method obvious enough outlook express users n t obvious enough mozilla users possibly outlook express windows n t equivalent feature understand feature intended make searching accessible introduce new users therefore needs obvious initiate search clear results users ca n t see view mail re going start worrying ve deleted messages mistake users figure works first time use applies clear button ca n t apply text field first place deleting contents text field intuitive pressing button marked clear indeed problem think could solved two simple changes making text field much shorter moment domination thread pane makes look compulsory n t h kan s extended wording could help m wording think show messages subject sender contains sounds better show messages whose subject sender contains m english expert anything removing advanced button makes look like submittable form cancel reset button n t believe point aid discoverability advanced search features user figured quick search curiosity would lead look advanced searching capabilities n t get wrong m saying current ui perfect anything maybe several alternatives could tested netscape s usability lab wonder comment jglick pst created attachment details outlook example comment alex bishop pst okay outlook similiar feature pedantic outlook express looks like outlook s search pane something users would display temporarily searching rather time would quick search however pane clear advanced find hyperlinks similiar quick search still think buttons good idea comment pierre

os environment designer decides scrap current keyboard conventions actually agree single keyboard layout function set doubt anybody alive live see happen using alt enter combination rather ctrl enter combination well alt click vs ctrl click goes one either standard conventions used windows windows ui design rules recall apple similar although different rules macintosh apps windows app simply n t break windows rules and or conventions satisfy users non windows os like final version mac app n t break macintosh rules satisfy non mac os etc oses satisfy needs conventions os writing keyboards also different physical layouts well different purposes modifier keys n t change around satisfy purpose different os personal sore point difference physical locations caps lock ctrl key standard unix win keyboard simply standard key layouts different changing therefore confuse average user typically uses one os average users windows users like n t make sense make windows users use limit convention used macintosh unix reverse situation applies well cross platform software mozilla simply can t use key layouts everything ui design rules keyboard layouts conflict well number mouse buttons eg find one mouse button terribly limiting s opinion valid next person s opinion testing version mozilla mozilla eventually rolled netscape well mozilla developers know employed netscape makes sense focus os used windows huge margin also makes sense builds mozilla beta testing versions issues operating systems windows case original prototype use windows convention error reported noted solution useful macos accustomed working standard win keyboard ctrl enter logical choice alt nearly always grouped different set tasks ctrl ctrl key mac windows ctrl key different meanings task sets well already mentioned alt enter opens properties list whatever object re working on with proper although unimplemented thing pressing alt enter would open properties webpage question using various w c html tags author tag etc well showing actual size html document types information web page alt enter also used often change full screen windowed dos command prompts also holds true winxp win version windows users n t break windows ui design rule satisfy mac users reason n t break app design rule mac satisfy windows users confuses users corresponding os neither rule set superior serve help users different is important use particular oses rules windows ctrl enter grouped companion enter key slightly different task enter alone eg ctrl enter inserts hard page break win word processors essentially hitting enter alone additional slightly different task starting new line new page rather simply new line similar uses really want homework look ctrl enter used windows ui rules came also problem ctrl click middle click toolbar bookmarks although alt click mentioned thought option click would mac users would use mac bit rusty likely yet implemented mozilla still testing stage bugreports tabbed pages

something unix users scroll something windows users wheel mouse users extremely unintuitive close binding used tabbed browsing would expect middle click tab load clipboard url tab close tab middleclick close anything anywhere else comment stephen moehle pst know one cares end users think linux user exactly opposite expectation middle click close tab seems quite natural middle click load url never used feature except accident always confused result comment brian g pst user find middle click open new tab useful use time keep place news sites like reading link another tab using middle click close tab makes sense since used middle click open would prefer behaviors stay never used middle click open clipboard url except middle click location bar comment jag peter annema pst see logic brian g s comment one could extend since middle clicking link generally opens link new window mean middle clicking title bar window close hmmm someone file rfe stephen moelle explain feel s natural middle clicking tab closes personally feel s natural middle clicking tab loads url currently selection clipboard tab s m used middle click pasting selected text use quite lot compare drag and drop

contentloadurl true preference set false quite think mozilla netscape usability testing see really good idea contentloadurl default true using linux years mozilla nearly found middle click to load a url behavior confusing figured going unless know middle click every time either deliberately accident load new web page get error weird error contents clipboard pretty random especially true expecting advent tabs middle click used pasting think middle click and load a url feature may confusing standard gnome kde user comment hampton maxwell pst see tab different purpose url bar url bar navigational tool tabs window management tool therefore user wants load url middle clicking middle clicking url bar tab anything else seems non intuitive already rfe open new tabs middle clicking tab bar behavior would fit also confusing creates different behavior windows linux current behavior broken anyway since using middle click load url tab causes issue load close request tab gets closed comment david hyatt pst reassigning new component owner comment max waterman pst would like point another unexpected interaction use netscape mozilla linux irix done long time extensively use middle click make browser go url middle clicking background page currently displayed seems natural n t used tabs extensively yet vote would tab jump clipboard contents url perhaps s w could validate contents see valid

finding page workaround use history however location document still lost comment garth wallace pdt suggestion comment probably even possible platforms comment peter trudelle pdt n t think reasonably consider viewed document unsaved sense documents programs explicitly opened editing modified yet saved already keep history reference viewed documents return n t mean close adding confirmation would mean getting warning dialog whenever closing browser unless first closed tabs could reasonably consider treating active modified forms unsaved work search results seems bit stretch since quite reproducible also squirrely issues forms left session history currently active also change apply similarly windows tabs since principles involved cc marlon ue input comment nick pietraniec pdt well user tell frequently move one window open usually one window tabs hours work look taskbar see windows open ll naturally start cycling closing often close window tabs open junk top like commented exact thing konsole s saved time recover window lot tabs open mozilla existed one window might agree since many windows tabs without makes sense someone might try close window thought garbage realize seconds later tabs open window comment peter trudelle pdt hmmm close windows seems like ctrl w would good fit usage pattern since cycles tab closing window say d like get confirmation dialog people generally poor predicting d actually use would react even though know personally good confirmation dialogs usually dismissed especially bad people become habituated eventually dismiss without even thinking thus making merely nuisance remember back early days dos many commands would put inane sure dialog sometimes even followed another really sure making really needed cases way recover unlikely event command intended perhaps needed could somehow get window back tabs perhaps clicking bookmark group history would sufficient comment nick pietraniec pdt perhaps think difference sure command occurs multiple tabs open m cycling bunch windows clicking x top notification would unique windows tabs open user would signaled probably would n t become desensitised way s proabably also reasonable put checkbox says n t show warning understand re coming notification boxes annoying think impact n t need notification would minimal could turn first time happened comment peter trudelle pdt n t using ctrl w want see tabs closed take do n t show checkbox frequently used justify unnecessary first imposition many users reluctant check box suffer ones check faced problem caused added way recover next proposal invariably ui pref added reset checkbox hundreds decisions years overly complex bloated browser perhaps one cases justified m inclined push back nearly proposals lest accept frivolous ones easily comment nick pietraniec pdt well n t think ve ever used ctrl w m clicking things taskbar maximize d move hands onto keyboard could probably try ctrl w closing windows would mean effort remember use special method closing windows mozilla since n t work applications tested konqueror ll give try though say exact feature konsole saves time perhaps ve become accustomed anyway wo n t break heart n t implemented personally shy away using tabs mozilla reason comment garth wallace pdt suggested alternate feature comment submitted bug comment peter trudelle pdt perhaps close affordances changed mean close tab mulitple tabs bit inconsistent comment timeless pdt trudelle would mean pr n window say pr napped domain triggered twenty new tabs d close tab hand risking new tabs focus comment jason bassford pdt let see review use ctrl w answered early thread lot people never used ctrl w change browsing habits bug confirmation apply every normal method exiting browser reason sticking ctrl w reason smaller tab x insufficient big main x still exists sometimes clicked mistake confirmation dialogues usually dismissed bad typically always close tabs exit browser s mistakenly click main x rather tab x closed point bug prevent mistakes therefore least browsing pattern would n t usually dismiss dialogue d normally use showed d clicked somewhere n t accident would useful n t know people normally intentionally exit browser multiple windows open often closing prior exiting something tells would n t m authority n t show checkbox first time imposition m sure agree let s say since option showing dialogue would obviously preference make default setting show confirmation window way first time imposition wish see dialogue turn everybody s happy alternative adding yet another pref seem reasons understand general modify behaviour main x button close current tab small one know would make small one redundant perhaps removed implemented clicked normally exit browser completely ctrl click comment jahf pdt n t think reasonably consider viewed document unsaved sense documents programs explicitly opened editing modified yet saved already keep history reference viewed documents return n t mean close asking m unsure though think answer negative going document history reestablish cookie settings and or referers and or items would make history stateful history adequate answer adding confirmation would mean getting warning dialog whenever closing browser unless first closed tabs could reasonably behavior think requested least duplicate bug n t want see dialog box hit main x tab open behave closing normal non tabbed window still nail occasion nearly often issue browsers common behavior means people using tabs never ever see really want close tabs dialog hence standard behavior least tabs take world remain status quo however hit main x multiple tabs open adding dialog change standard behavior yet accepted standard tabs unless view mdi multiple document interface windows case standard n t follow ask closing multiple mdi windows additionally ve mentioned duplicate bug n t care dialog active install mozilla make pref tabbed brower preferences leave default consider treating active modified forms unsaved work search results seems bit stretch since quite reproducible also squirrely issues forms left session history adds set code encompasses saving forms security data issues accompany avoid adding dialog interface even see needing pref security reasons net gain direction mind though able save unsubmitted forms could attractive feature elsewhere generally would currently active also change apply similarly windows tabs since principles involved cc marlon ue input n t see separate windows would need dialog if also multiple tabs somehow tried close generally speaking accidentally close one window tabs wo n t affect others unless ve tried kill processes instead clicking x ui notes use w thread s many people use desire get mozilla friendly mouse interface users regarding x button close tab time deviant people expect multiple document interface also strongly agree problems comes pagez scripted behave badly purpose pr n etc n t believe adequately determine windows viewed saved versus unsaved unless start tracking tab clicks determine tab raised foreground even often working tab hours trying keep page documentation etc would still desire dialog even view saved pages summary personally would like see n t expect get exactly want n t hurt explicit main x currently closes tabs would multiple tabs open confirm want close entire browsing window main x would behave today single tab document open keeping behavior standard browsers windows would unaffected main x nothing needed small tab x still works expected comment peter trudelle pdt timeless already provide explicit close window m speculating whether d want close interpreted close tab currently ctrl w jason n t suggesting ctrl w solution everyone asking fit one person s usage pattern solution default would mean people would get benefit anything hope would fit typical usage well enough enabled default n t heard anyone say explicit close window commands the big x put confirmation dialog though n t see justification inconsistent either nominating machv mozilla certainly late beta seems substantial issue consider track resolve necessary good get feedback typical users none us rest getting hand bug report people start posting page long comments quote comments length discussion moved newsgroups comment marlon bishop pdt keep mind case met non tab users however troublesome tab combo users since occurs commonly distinct situation qualifies warning pref suggest produce dialog would force decision one behavior another user overcome user predetermination close anything everything course safe setting default seperate windows ___________________________________________________________________________ window close contains web page contained page tab avoid losing web pages close window may seperate individual windows hitting seperate windows hit close window close window page tabs check remember preference avoid warning next time always change setting later tab browser preferences remember preference seperate windows close window ___________________________________________________________________________ seperate windows idea something came mind close currently viewed tab background tabs spawn cascaded windows n t mind hearing suggestions however need provide safe level default warning possibly preference depending end handling comment nick pietraniec pdt n t know like idea spawning windows n t know really see point wanted separate windows never would opened tabs first place think might warrant separate bug report record also think changing behavior big x window decoration would huge mistake m sure almost ui usability people would agree s intuitive expected behavior comment peter trudelle pdt n t understand pref system would remembering hitting either buttons express pref valid windows also add confirmation n t way cancel close comment nick pietraniec pdt see comment add checkbox says never show comment marlon bishop pdt nick less question whether users intend pages windows vs tabs anonymity closing losing pages n t presently view separating pages different windows allows user opportunity view close page window fashion still obey user intent close current page thereby breaking window convention fact users forget remaining background pages re discussing problem first place agree n t break window conventions would like see tabs windows peacefully coexist however n t many applications handle problem multiple document interface tab fashion base behavior dialog feature proposing obey window closing conventions everytime something safe default allow user customize get speed convenience comes price multi page losses agree may somewhat unusual solution meet requirements would add cancel button right side peter s suggestion ___________________________________________________________________________ window close contains web page contained page tab avoid losing web pages close window may seperate individual windows hitting seperate windows hit close window close window page tabs check remember preference avoid warning next time always change setting later tab browser preferences remember preference seperate windows close window cancel ___________________________________________________________________________ comment peter trudelle pdt m still sure pref would remembered checked box clicked separate would subsequent close multi tab windows cause break separate windows instead checked clicked cancel case user exits windows minimized would seem fit pattern closing pages view also believe large performance cost opening pages new window comment marlon bishop pdt m still sure pref would remembered checked box clicked separate would subsequent close multi tab windows cause break separate windows instead yes would break would also close page view time close checked clicked cancel weird guess either ignore checkbox disable cancel button click checkbox case user exits windows minimized s different case user n t care open windows exit would n t different d favor remembering state like opera let s discuss road also believe large performance cost opening pages new window re right different new window story might something consider however perhaps stick simple question like comment ___________________________________________________________________________ window close contains web page contained page tab hit close window close window tabs within close current page try clicking close button tab bar using shift ctrl w select checkbox warn avoid warning warn close window cancel ___________________________________________________________________________ cc ing jatin help wording comment peter trudelle pdt sounds kinda strange open new windows response

guarding accidental closure entire window plus s specifically popping confirmation dialogue putting setting tab comment jonas j rgensen pdt close tabs removed see bug comment sam j fleet pdt fyi someone change bug duplicate unconfirm thank feedback m setting bug unconfirm new think bug make find addition mozilla comment robert tweed pdt ve discussing wishlist group would like add comments firstly original observation easy press ctrl q close everything instead ctrl w close tab keys right next mistake tabs open happy say definitely prompt user attempts close browser means close windows tabs currently visible user compared correctly unsaved documents prompt applications also suggested incorrect analogy work easily recovered however tabs open simultaneously tracking insignificant task also incorrect assume true unsaved data web pages fact contain unsaved user data simple example form yet posted especially webmail complex example would user dependant dhtml content represent unsaved data may exist hidden tab even current one say point checking cases hidden pages considered unsaved think s still fair assume one window tab open user really mean exit however one window tab close request ambiguous prompting mechanism quite simple need encumber users really wish quit everything simply display prompt following options prehaps using radio buttons ok cancel dialog like windows x shutdown trying exit mozilla really intention close instances mozilla default close current mozilla browser window displayed one tabbed window open close current tab displayed current window tabbed least one window open one extra confirm click press enter exit mozilla great labour people really want exit however users could potentially save lot wasted valuable time additionally default option

latter case implementation differs products handle situation cases operating system shutting assumption exists user expects browser windows remain open shutting additional tabs may unintentional users shut windows always remain computers see dialog boxes appear since normally expected introduces dialog box prevents normal shutdown operating system unlike cases applications may cause behavior introduced part normal operation browser rather result extraordiary event implementation dialog box feature activated default may expected user shuts computer users routinely shut computers without first closing mozilla longer able multiple tabs open also introduces security issue users whose computers remain active expected computer shut turning feature serves work around negates beneficial
