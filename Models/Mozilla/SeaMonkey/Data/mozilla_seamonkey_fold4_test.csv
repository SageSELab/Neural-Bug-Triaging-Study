remove view sort thread add view messages threaded comment david a cobb pst concerning date use sort seeing lot cases lately answer message occurs list question darned annoying best cases message date utterly bogus sender s clock wild easiest way handle live more difficult neat way would pick also earliest date received header received headers applied message passes net among mta s likely careful time home user sender s date earliest received date b hours received simply disqualify sender s date use earliest received whole later part much nice n t damn busy change important able read thread conversation question followed answer comment m_mozilla pst mailsmith barebones com uses latest received header date message date recieved header dates available uses message download date first glance seems bit backward use latest header could end conversations read order john s message got routed fifteen servers made see mary s reply john s message see john s message valid criticism however alternative use earliest received header date problem using date header early received headers forged later ones forged mail clients trust date headers early received headers date information allow spammers sort messages top inbox queue sending messages next year date d rather see occasional out of order conversation due slow servers client date misconfiguration give spammers ability jump top queue bits matt comment david a cobb pst mail clients trust date headers early received headers date information allow spammers sort messages top inbox queue sending messages next year date sad true regarding sender s date ve never seen received date forged however could ameliorated somewhat totally disqualifying date days arbitrary today network never slow message gets queued long likewise

chronologically received header could potentially created artificially author message however use latest received header come reader s nntp reliable comment jonas sicking sicking pst spammers n t

date since mail would end amost old read mail among read today mails comment m_mozilla pst spammers n t bother spammers ve received spam month yes last eight days pre dated post dated forged date

spammers use first date way get right mail mailboxes comment david a cobb pst m jonas last comment also however use latest received header come reader s nntp reliable would reliable also would contain network delays would order received purpose trying reliable time origin get question sorted answer hacked dates tend stand way out of band problem cases arise everyone synchs pc clock innocently issues mail bad timestamps comment m_mozilla pst hmmm reading comments bug think m bit unclear objections recent suggestions date sorting think folks thinking m talking date sort instead threaded sort m m talking date sort within threaded sort threading turned notion threaded view follows references headers primarily possibly subject lines references headers found factors relevant dates could used sort two replies relative common original message n t cruicial threaded view important thing re replies original message one reply sent and or recieved sooner understand bug s adding non crucial secondary sort date within threaded view setting aside paragraph let s look threaded view works without secondary sort follow references headers threaded view work well formed messages always nest answer messages within question message answers replies date sorting really n t impact things threaded view built refernces headers read thread first reading outer level message reading nested inner messages ll always read question answer assuming answer sent reply question references header properly added message things work even users maliciously coordinate bad date values forged received headers screw sorting date n t see objection question answer order relevant threading well formed messages always make painfully clear reply outer messages questions inner messages answers introduce secondary sorting date case could anything else like sender message length number capital letters header means alice sends message bob replies alice s message claude also replies alice s message s threaded view messages bob claude show nested alice s original message secondary sort determines whether bob s message appears claude s alice wrote question bob claude wrote answers ll reading alice s question either answer matter sort messages bob claude secondary sort determines two answers read first alice question bob answer claude answer alice question claude answer bob answer matter method use secondary sort within threaded view underlying fact threaded view ensures read questions answers s settled recent comments directed reasonable method sorting messages date pc users accidentally intentionally set dates wrong time folks n t know whether re daylight savings time others never set time zone buy machine still others intentionally set dates avoid licence shareware expirations folks battery problems throw back start of epoch everytime power mail news servers tend reliable argues using received headers download time date sorting spammers intentionally forge date headers also often forge first couple recieved headers stuck message one way catching spam follow received header chains spot forged headers first couple received headers ones lower re viewing headers mail message reliable recent received headers reliable hence suggestion date sorting follow mailsmith s lead sort recent received header download date n t available question answer relationships important sorting date using method within threaded view destroy relationships hide way sort date method outside threaded view yes method may sort answers questions however suspect far less frequently end users s clock settings would use date headers sort date case q a relationships interest using threaded view rather date sort primary message organization understand bug s second level organization within threaded

comment tuukka tolvanen sp pdt n t see discussion specifics siblings thread groups sorted headers pick dates spammers may mangle headers contain time information relevant issue issue siblings threaded

specifically happens mozilla mail running mozilla launching mail closing browser windows may command line handling thing sure jag thoughts comment peter jag annema pdt yeah s browser n t know better browser mozilla whole n t run yet thus try first time browser starts thing solution simple move arguments check cmdlineurlused check ve got bug somewhere let dig still first time per session thing open browser window accel n better solution would move first time per session url load magic apprunner pass url load arguments thus automatically getting per session comment scott macgregor pdt hey alec never launch mozilla mail always bring browser first launch mail happen close browser window later browser windows open see comment alec flett pdt still seeing ve tried without mail homepage noticed url homepage appears urlbar bug appears start loading people comment david bienvenu pdt yes starts loading home page second url comes along interrupts first seems comment eric hedstr pdt using win k longer see bug running mozilla mail clicking linkified bugzilla url mail message however still see running mozilla mail clicking go bugzilla look bonsai pop up mozilla menu taskbar still navigator set launch blank page see bug mean navigator window opens stays blank instead going bugzilla bonsai comment alec flett pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment alec flett pdt might dupe bug

scott macgregor pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment alec flett pdt finally spent time investigating problem basically code checks cmdlineurlused set even url given command line fix pretty easy might end reorganizing code comment viswanath ramachandran pdt think need bring back onto mozilla list alec look thanks comment gilles doyen pdt m using linux mozilla build upgraded recent build stumble upon problem seems lot like bug s happens mail open send message hyperlinks http www oeone com open email click hyperlink opens browser window n t load link remains blank link clicked shows url field case s important default settings browser open www mozilla org problem related one thanks help comment alec flett pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment alec flett pdt ok found chaotic first thought seems link gets clicked mail two things happen new browser window opened uri loader loads url window problem two actions happen asynchronously n t even ask make sure window finished opening order kick load poking hours ve decided fix going risky many states new window open worth risking cases fix one hacky fix m continuing work hopefully patch m soon comment scott macgregor pdt know broke caused regression maybe could figure less risky fix would present comment alec flett pdt basically re wrote code decides url load account different cases opening command line opening via dde opening via uri loader opening menu etc plus taking account users preferences w r t blank homepage last page visited one edge case concern fix case break another one fixed rtm take sorry mail guys people keep browser window open i e re likely using mail re using browser well case average user likely already browser window open thus plagued bug comment eric hedstr pdt web centric use e mail keep open day browser windows come go need comment alec flett pdt well re people referred look m going fix m providing reasons pushing comment peter trudelle pdt m sure alec s supposition true mail users general certainly although admittedly small minority case launch product almost always bring mail first since new messages much interesting web page n t bring browser window need one generally reason view links mail bites lot said agree current target showstopper beta comment jag peter annema pdt really want bug gone simplest way create browser instance object mail news startup code set cmdlineurlused true add similar code composer needed ugly hack would lines code create object set boolean explicitely destroy object right way fix though make browser window open blank unless s passed uri load window arguments however requires whole bunch changes definitely post material comment seak teng fong pdt well peter trudelle add name small minority interested mailer browser time mozilla mail mail client compete outlook express support many different languages well unicode mozilla mail vb virus free comment timeless pdt n t switched yet m like trudelle use mail quite start browsing comment gilles doyen pdt add name lsit minority work environment emails used all day whereas web browsing totally secondary n t consider alec s argument valid although reasons example complexity fix risk associated

nsbrowsercontenthandler handlecontent calling wwatch openwindow spec url arguments arguments dialog opened called standard window open creates window element window arguments meant newly created window never saw spec basically threw spec black hole never seen result browser window would open window would clue url supposed loading would best guess try load browser s homepage circumstances wierd fluke url command line subsequent windows first one would magically manage load url user clicked mail totally random lucky ever worked needed able create navigator window chrome specified uri clicked window arguments n t want browser try loading uri docloader actually load uri moments later fact load uri already begun would wrong browser try load anyway use another argument window arguments window arguments uses pass special string dontload means put url title bar actually load patch attached things please ignore cmdlineurl macro changes wo n t check part another bug ideally d

photographs people want see faces feet graphics intermediate colors coded alternating two colors chess board pattern within region common computer generated images automatically resizing large images also encourage web site authors participate two bad practices authors n t want images resized reasons mentioned put image html page instead linking directly image thumbnails waste bandwidth give porn

width knows intersting hacks people might add digress based mozilla netscape experts think would useful zoom option one item fit window perhaps fit width would better reiterate comment make sense

document displayed make image clickable zoom in out cursor depending current state switch scale to fit allow vendor pref specify whether image starts scale to fit mean like hourglass cursor sounds good could without driving people crazy changing cursors whenever go image user discovery things like would best achieved welcome mozilla wizard something like welcome windows xp movie microsoft n t know want see zoom cursor images guess kept viewing images url opposed inside web page would fine right click could bring zooming context menu left click could toggle maybe pre set zoom states something think images initially shown though want allow vendor pref without breaking standards maybe misunderstood though anything zooming css dom model think ie proprietary zooming css dom magic adopt real standard careful make standards mess perpetuate zooming images page etc think best taken make form elements etc also zoomable another bug comment brian netdragon bober pdt alan ui craziness

want idea serving lone image allowing sticky scaling pref equivalent serving audio content without providing volume control site going care whether mozilla scales ie tool used users case behavioral expectation set clearly meeting comment jeremy m dolan pdt would n t dream overriding users wants times scaling causes loss content way web site indicate times default view image unscaled http header x image noscale x image scale mozilla nscp default scaling images though s pref reserve x image header overrides userpref default view ie would way toggle scaled unscaled view viewing image users wo n t know two different modes s important web site indicate mode appropriate cases matter comment james ross pdt would n t simple enough user pref three options always rezise never resize auto first two obvious auto would resize image s big leave along s big visible area unless website says otherwise whatever means decide upon decide comment james ross pdt oh one thing whatever option whatever site says user always able change scaled image loaded comment peter trudelle pdt scaling always discards content displayed image m sure header would really mean maybe hint suggestion problem think would need standardized supported ie order catch prefs m sure always resize would mean n t obvious anyone would always want resize images ie seems cover bases simple checkbox enable automatic image resizing really need anything comment brian netdragon bober pdt biesi assuming non automatic scaling implemented n t see would require placing image browser frame css image resize hidden user options default image zooming simple altering view menu follows removing text zoom view scaling document text full document single image v custom fit window auto default ascii art fun mozilla could ship fit window auto default depending decide context menu would scaling would shown title bar mozilla regular web page single image menu view menu would disabled context menu could still shown individual images without default option default would whatever page s image intrinsic size full document placed menu full document zooming text zoomed separate bug included show section view menu could changed regarding comment jeremy could abused sites ie anyway s issue ie allow disabling sites comment james ross pdt comment always resize would mean always resizes image s big ignores whatever may use allow thr server indicate preference could easily implement using two boolean prefs scale large images automatically allow server override would give three options mentioned comment would add ability specify server n t express preference still allowing server override comment christian biesinger n t email ping irc pdt options default image zooming simple altering view menu follows removing text zoom oh ok n t think menu command would course work fine thinking click on the image way someone suggested bug would work js enabled afaik however email conversation hixie appears fit window thing seems difficult implement least max height max width way used aspect ratio respected important cases dislike server override thing three reasons servers send header mozilla even fewer care whether image resized servers tell user view image netdemon somehow dislike adding scaling submenu would add items directly view menu currently scaling menu would cases contain one item document text full document implemented yet afaik creating submenu time contains one item sounds bad comment james ross pdt comment ve whipped lines javascript scalling stuff including aspect ratio preservation obviously javascript solution n t know how what stuff output view images would possible chrome page comment brian netdragon bober pdt james server override separate issue bug biesi somehow dislike adding scaling submenu creating submenu time contains one item sounds bad scaling submenu would put bug fixed would two items menu dislike server override thing three reasons separate issue bug anyway however email conversation hixie appears fit window thing seems difficult implement web pages single images going james ross said realized people rarely would set automatically scale arbitrary number like therefore allow auto fit checked unchecked auto fit checked image initially scaled window s max width height whichever would allow image right aspect ratio custom also checked percentage n t necessary next custom see menu since displayed title bar window except title bar present clicked custom would show current scale image automatically set could see auto scaled might also nice able unconstrain proportions check box within custom dialog box set height width separately like photoshop using percentage absolute pixels em auto fit n t checked image loaded scaled whichever percentage selection custom checked explain custom open dialog _always_ shows current scale regardless whether auto fit mode flexibility allows people auto scale also scale images open certain percentage although latter rarely necessary would helpful people browsing lot identically sized images brings us second ui suggestion like better view scaling document text full document single image v custom v auto fit window prefs would need one pref would either set auto value representing zoom percentage allowed unconstraining proportions pref would pref constraining checkbox x percentage possibly em px could probably even allow width height set auto pixel value proportions unconstrained much like css allows comment brian netdragon bober pdt james imagine would done chrome using xul javascript none visible user contains image xul user would probably dynamically generated within xpcom c would need chrome privileges n t looked though guess comment christian biesinger n t email ping irc pdt scaling submenu would put bug fixed would two items menu would one time hardly ever view stand alone images fit window thing seems difficult implement web pages single images single images n t care web pages going james ross said realized people rarely would set automatically scale arbitrary number like therefore allow auto fit checked unchecked see need anything auto fit comment christian biesinger n t email ping irc pdt n t know how what stuff output view images would possible chrome page document single images generated c code could maybe give script chrome privileges c code like know done however sure mstoltz would agree solution comment james ross pdt comment comment ok see can t do n t get chrome status image viewing document one generated single images somehow always jave javascript enabled n t stand chance image auto fit stuff unless want make auto fit dependant user javascript enabled n t think would good idea imo comment brian netdragon bober pdt scaling submenu would put bug fixed would two items menu would one time hardly ever view stand alone images already said could disabled image available removed menu fit window thing seems difficult implement web pages single images single images n t care web pages single images n t see would hard might time consuming wo n t hard going james ross said realized people rarely would set automatically scale arbitrary number like therefore allow auto fit checked unchecked see need anything auto fit would like something else besides n t think need go anything like separate x scaling s really something image editor terms raw percentages maintain image proportions would like see also solves problem change auto scaled image back original size would make bit functional ie s implementation need one pref would contain either percentage default using custom scaling auto btw going happen window re sized image going re sized accordingly gives another argument options resize window scaling like remove auto resize window leaving image correct scaling perhaps flip back forth page image comment brian netdragon bober pdt would one time hardly ever view stand alone images speak n t like grayed could put single image submenu directly view menu full zooming bug fixed comment christian biesinger n t email ping irc pdt would one time hardly ever view stand alone images already said could disabled image available removed menu address issue item usually greyed therefore useless single images n t see would hard might time consuming wo n t hard referring css driven approach rather using js also solves problem change auto scaled image back original size um use whatever used scale btw know way give page chrome privileges test need one pref would contain either percentage default using custom scaling auto d use int pref use auto really want take route btw going happen window re sized image going re sized accordingly definitely least set auto n t like grayed could put single image submenu directly view

chrome trigger image documents basically bubbling onclick handler browser triggers re looking image document comment brian netdragon bober pdt biesi also solves problem change auto scaled image back original size um use whatever used scale btw know way give page chrome privileges test mean autoscaled need way make return like ie multiple percentage values logical next step need one pref would contain either percentage default using custom scaling auto d use int pref use auto really want take route agreed although float might better since people might want scale using fractions percents n t like grayed could put single image submenu directly view menu full zooming bug fixed thereby eliminating scaling submenu right yes full zooming bug fixed bug btw agree done chrome js still need slight

always complete something short like front page portal full url page deep inside site guess backend n t changed m curious n t seem comment marlon bishop pdt old x auto complete would first complete domain ever visited one page within entire domain would go ahead complete entire url visited couple pages within domain would first give domain typed additional backslash continue typing deeper deeper

motion sort disturbing may come x undergone mind numbing experience learning live ie however new computers internet d think latter behavior would alarming first find inline history based autocompletion urls using careful non disruptive visual cues easier adapt albeit relatively less inclusive probably less informative added advantage understood simply real beauty x method chances url auto complete incorrectly moment hit enter although still possible slim easily recoverable every keystroke variety matches history diminishes speaking real terms rare users hit delete spacebar correct autocomplete hitting enter likelihood url intend type happens root another valid word english whatever assuming many common urls start valid words prefixes chances obscured course fact valid word must history far likely user returning previously visited url typing word prefix previously visited url totally impossible therfore x system high likelihood auto completion result one two positive outcomes time re ready push enter desired url history autocompleted full url typed without interruption one realistic negative outcome follow requirements met case user happened need prefix valid word root popular urls use valid words roots valid word root prefix url already visited history remember course main motivation autocomplete people tend frequently return places ve n t buy try using browser n t autocomplete whatsoever see like try opera point x n t perfect s pretty quiet s dependable predictable negative outcome reasonably quickly corrected terms choosing default behavior far outweighs impact jarring motions blurry sophistication ie style characteristics make x style inline autocomplete better candidate default furthermore feel improve x visual cues using faint grayed text and or bolding prefs issue general think d much safer user experience always believed providing basic tool empowers users selectively add complexity discretion assuming experienced users notion contrast

feel competent enough make comment marlon bishop pdt s peripheral menu pops click menu title menu bar clicking menu title results expected outcome s innate difference task typing characters text field clicking something ok lost install internet explorer see particular thing behaves browser order make decision mozilla s ui people n t feel competent enough make bear s signature ie feature claim percent market think ve established themeselves even wording actual label n t concern much interaction writer comment donnie roberts pdt also like old autocompletion url would autocompleted url want right pressed enter however would ok autocompletion either triggerred keystroke ie pressing tab hilited added text required extra keystroke enter accept example would type www deb tab bu tab enter get www debian org bugs elaborating selection could accepted hitting right arrow end keys example causing autocompleted text loose special hiliting however form automatic completion may confusing using tab key hilited text would accepted user simply pressed enter also note perhaps autocompletion could work one path component time would mimic shell s autocompletion stopping directory level example one directory named bar home foo entering home f tab returns home foo entering home f tab tab returns home foo bar etc fyi bugs related discussion ordering autocompletion choices bug autocompletion matching entire string bug comment marlon bishop pdt keep mind tab key switches focus next form element ca n t really shell style autocomplete unless willing break focus navigation comment andreas franke gone pdt never use tab leave url bar would willing break functionality seem bugs people agree disagree tab key behave e g bug maybe warrants pref comment aaron kaluszka pdt future pref mentioned timer option added give people like old option back much better imo alleviate problems experienced people like donr ie pref set timeout autocompleting url comment donnie roberts pdt delays adjustable delay would help avoid unwanted autocompletions longer delay less likely user get unwanted autocompletion also makes autocompletion less useful slower therefore delay kept small unwanted autocompletions avoided another means per second suggestion see previous comment autocompletion would require user confirm autocompleted text manner ie pressing right arrow key move cursor past hilited portion url acknowledge may users expected old behavior press enter accept autocompleted url reduce confusion could also mark text specially ie italicize autocompleted part let user know part actual url yet could better solution users know tab tab like completion would confused multiple purposes tab hand key trigger autocompletion could right arrow ctrl right arrow instead tab correction bug ordering autocompletion choices bug comment trent mick pdt attaching patch fixes autocomplete xbl xpfe components autocomplete behave like ie s autocomplete test xul n t know mozilla s urlbar uses autocomplete binding komodo s find replace dialog hopefully useful discussion think mozilla behave think echoed hyatt autocomplete binding behaves follows two distinct autocomplete textbox behaviour ie urlbar use tab character cycle list matches current string in line entry widget use tab autocomplete hitting tab terminates autocomplete event bubbled cause focus switched next widget tab order patch offers usetabcomplete option select want default usetabcomplete true i e urlbar behaviour previous behaviour btw think default false textbox type autocomplete usetabcomplete true hitting return finishes autocomplete closes results popup hitting down up arrow pg down up synchronously build results list open popup trent comment trent mick pdt created attachment details diff review patch autocomplete binding behave like ie autocomplete comment trent mick pdt created attachment details test xul file try autocomplete binding behaviour comment mike pinkerton reading bugmail pdt get better sorting method urls m fine auto completing ve grown accustomed current behavior find s alright get infernal bug comment keyser sose pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment jacek piskozub pdt marking mostfreq dups comment james paige pdt autocomplete behavior like netscape constantly found typing www moz right right right right right right right right right shift end del enter current drop down autocomplete behavior mozilla regularly type www moz enter comment aaron kaluszka pdt well netscape would www moz wait split sec autocomplete enter better used netscape www moz wait split sec see dropdown selection want enter crap www moz found dbl click bksp www moz enter comment michal hramrach suchanek pdt add opinion dislike autocomleption enters text may submitted asked wery annoyed browsers completed url typing hit enter brought page want expect people may want many make autocompletion demand text completed special key pressed tab right arrow whatever ca n t key bindings configurable make optional means may turned prefs automagic completion make optional hint autocompletion demand grayed text something shows would completed b another problem autocompletion sorting occurs mozilla s dropdown well sorting done alphabetically makes difficult get autocomleted something different first match ie bugzilla abisource com get bugzilla mozilla org quite well tested matching urls whole browsing history autocompleting url bar idea good long better sorting algorithm developed users may prefer match urls typed urls typed succesfully loaded pref c think sorting done way allows quickly select url long list one find first char two urls history differ divide history groups urls char group select representative based alphabetical order mostfreq lastvisited sort order based alphabet mostfreq lastvis possibly different sorting one yielded representative make cycle list place beginning pulldown need items fill visible part menu add subgroups groups take one character differentiate groups last problem usually cant guess correct url first letters part completion completes first dot slash ca n t make bad mistakes diff completion completes letters n t differ lets coose next important letter think best solution unexperienced user on request part to diff completion indication to be completed part transparent unintrusive stopping anything important gives great control completed text cost additional keystrokes comment dave pdt n t think care much removing cc comment patrick keller pdt fine current implementation although miss old agree threeway pref ie style ie text inputted ns x style problem thus far current implementation nonsensical way chooses choose domain go example type www p get personals yahoo com enjoy good laugh instead www penny arcade com visit far frequently actually www front m thinking url selection less retarded would n t really miss old style least old style n t replace www p personals actually completed typed comment gabriel seah pdt user presses delete autocomplete completes url moz try autocomplete url anymore erases text location bar types new address visits new page aforementioned pref types autocomplete behaviour comment scott a colcord pdt adding vote enable old behavior least via pref comment ptrourke pdt adding vote following behavior non greedy inline autocomplete dropdown works dropdown currently works s good miss autocomplete words starting first letter www protocol host name www match commonly visited host starts letter right arrow needed finish complete arrow dropdown box first letter top level directory name triggers autocomplete directory name etc make sense thanks comment joe hewitt gone pdt landed bunch prefs allow customize autocomplete behavior please open prefs go navigator smart browsing click advanced button customize rejoice bug moot marking fixed comment ben ruppel pdt sorry spam noticed issue discussion lot users miss one key autocomplete entry without move hands hitting

attachment details image patch create higlight colored better image one version highlight colored personally like one better s in face looks professional imho jennifer mentioned selected message labeled via menus color might immediately reflected thread pane example image actually change fly comment kmurray pst sure agree like first screen shot better selection face background color changes message selected n t see first screen shot though something represented nicely second unselected messages labeled bear color font color changed white background think looks nice iirc spec comment scottputterman pst like second screen shot better think multiple selection colors confusing comment kmurray pst see thing ll balance drowned effect dark blue selection think use though multi colored selection grow point ll need see action instead looking comment scottputterman pst agreed though get see demo sean s machine confusing statement came think three choices pros cons keep regular selection color label text color pro selection color less confusing con label color might conflict selection color become unreadable keep regular selection color white text color pro selection color less confusing text always readable con label n t apparent bad setting label since s feedback unselecting use label selection color white text color pro always read label color apparent con colorful opinion least con hard tell selection ranking problem checking waiting feedback comment timeless pst could n t use darken lighten label color selection option would possible see picture think text selected would white case comment scottputterman pst reference point outlook list comments comment ben ruppel pst say go selection selection nice labeling something neato color n t gratifiying n t get see immediately message selected people make messages color selection color already know change label color something else see problem d say case social darwinism let nature take course comment brice ruth pst created attachment details color labels entourage v x mac os x s label colors look like entourage highlighted noticed n t really option select color highlight color social darwinism n t really come play prefer changing font color changing background believe change immediate also entourage colors choose seem pastels nice eyes may better primary colors shown previous screen shots comment brice ruth pst addendum previous posting create category custom color highlight color defined aqua carbon os x apps set message s category color close select message instead disappearing font becomes black reverts category color selected seems pretty good tactic heuristic detects category color close highlight color make font default revert afterwards comment kmurray pst think avoid color conflicts limiting palette although heuristic might cool m also opposed entourage method think two different selection colors base m still wondering invasive obnoxious would change selection clor based label color try see like different approach comment scottputterman pst sure try different approach opinion goes really well toy factory theme great modern classic comment brice ruth pst agree entirely putterman keep mind selection standard across ui start haphazardly changing way selection looks looses uniformity thereby looses meaning sense based previous comment apparently colors available labels limited many colors colors control theme could good bad would vote standard set colors labels able add change standard set everything else mozilla configurable max many times much necessary useful feature especially folks use email professionally need organize much use hanging file folders documents limited comment scottputterman pst brice reasons colors limited may limited researching feature sean seth hyatt decided would much work change style rules dynamically instead re hardcoding colors stylesheet since re hardcoding colors re stuck limited amount re hardcoding style rules ends either style rules color support currently colors sean supporting style rules could performance impact choices limited think spec says sean correct ve explained incorrectly comment jglick pst wonder common many messages selected one time common regular selection color label text color seems best common label selection color white text color bit overwhelming common select one message time ensures text read seems pretty readable default colors reference eudora uses guess lean toward modern skin default label colors worry users change label colors default selection color

firstly use rate calculate time remaining download use different code entirely i e important transfer rate grand scheme things secondly instantaneous instantaneous ignorant reading code patch appears calculate transfer rate based past second correct shorter time period use calculate rate jump around less useful longer time period use calculate rate less adjust permanent changes rate flicking isdn switch finishing another download less useful think balance two probably want use weighted logarithmic system one takes account transfer rates whole time download progress gives progressively weight recent rates course n t want build vast database rates download goes purpose recalculating transfer rate every second mathematicians comment doug hanley pdt patch made calculates download speed approximately every second word instantaneous really misnomer sorry time left still calculated average speed though would appropriate since quite annoying see time left flying place kind like weighted scale idea might still tendency creep actual download speed albeit faster plus mathemitician would n t know also might nice add code detects huge jumps download speeds see download stalled isdn switch flicks adjust accordingly finally maybe could take average speeds last seconds say use personally would prefer method leans toward recent rate overall average thats still like idea two d l rates one average one recent might confusing end user thoughts comment peter asemann pdt thought exponential smoothing could used calculate transfer rate display rather method predict upcoming transfer rate really makes sense well weighting transfer rate last second one second last transfer rate hopping really predictable s reason transfer rate actual second probably like past second like second last s

refuses load regard particular raskin style search as you type ui makes sense reliably perform search immediately within say half second doubt s case ldap even large personal address book slow disk pref determine delay would make less annoying even users savvy enough able twiddle pref really need search button instead search directory probably look since re necessarily searching directory please n t call search dialog addressbook search dialog addressbook n t word dialog s window manager window title let user know wordlessly type particular window try advanced address search instead buttons add boolean add expression people likely understand add row button add following three items bottom attribute popup menu separator following following choosing following following turns current row

equal equal less less disable option text types greater greater ditto remove colons options conditions menu change names attributes re english e g first name instead firstname secondary web address instead webpage comment ben ruppel pdt excuse m misinterpreting seems simple search results addressbook showing entries including search criteria problem user get back seeing entire addressbook perhaps would better simple search like ns x match first letters name know need times anyway also know pretty much mis implemented feature seeing text says show names containing s thoughts comment cuchulainn pdt ben user get back viewing entire addressbook removing query essentially query translates show everything case search query show name containing exactly example typing rek bring entries containing derek think understand point type example m query box would like get names starting rather entries containing letter m think current behaviour works well though d like hear opinions anybody else thinks ns x behaviour would preferable matthew would like discuss detail ll irc irc mozilla org addressbook day today comment michael t babcock pdt matthew in place search begun suitable delay typing terms milliseconds suspended typing continues indexing formats would allow us simply narrow results rather causing new search user continued typing case ldap directory exception might made simply make initial suitable delay longer since opening prematurely closing multiple ldap queries might considered poor behaviour rate easy to use ctrl f find anywhere address book function needed sooner later large address books useful ca n t currently knowledge easily list people certain domain example comment jglick pdt instead adding whole additional toolbar possible incorporate search field existing toolbar shown http www mozilla org mailnews specs addressbook images abdes gif think confusing user choose one item search directory completely different item selected address book list pane would good one place select ab directory searched comment jglick pdt ok incorporating toolbar probably n t possible space issues instead using dropdown menu additional toolbar select ab directory search using existing list ab directories left pane see screenshot comment jglick pdt created attachment details ui proposal comment jglick pdt view menu search toolbar users close want comment john marmion pdt okay ve thinking bit address book gui comments first automatic search as you type feature m undecided best solution think default behaviour searching happens type something press search button enter couple people said lack guaranteed instant feedback automatic search problem would lot worse slow connections large address books also s possible whatever m typing search box might something m trying visually copy list existing results would n t want existing list disappear halfway typing still trying refer mechanisms rely arbitrary delays generally bad accessibility reasons case slow typist could slowed even search kicking every letter typed possibly accessibility implications ca n t think right n t huge problem making automatic search behaviour option people particularly attached although say n t generally like adding options really need make something work would work perfectly well without make option though may also worth adding option specify many characters type automatic searching starts someone pointed s little silly searching first letter s likely d want wait d typed two three wanted force search reached many could always press search button return perhaps could hardcode limit one two characters quick search search name fields might good actually searched fields perhaps ones currently visible search results pane thought automatic search ought feedback results pane search happening busy cursor pane least search button ought change stop button search happening interrupt s taking long time results also ought displayed found s possible rather together end n t know s works demo showed found things rather quickly mean user manually sort results every time though little annoying perhaps could clever enough sort results using whatever column last selected sort soon search complete mean n t wait slow connection record want happens first one found ve also mocked quick screenshot shows could tidy toolbar bit http gnome

criteria every organization larger maybe two people wanting use mozilla mail client comment curtis nelson pst needed add cents agree previous two comments work state gov k users enterprise mail ldap browsers email clients upgrade path enterprise environments materialized time mozilla browser continued improve state finally upgrades govs slow good news netscape move explorer tough going back least another ten years see enterprise features mail client important feature current development stage last great hope keeping us clutches redmond lose users like difficult time getting back comment stewart james pst chime m another organisation stuck using netscape x ldap support mozilla users getting sick behind browser technology think user interface looking pretty well aged around staff plus around student machines ldap soon probably mean email base move ms solution labs either get msie likely opera think highly mozilla project occurs think machines never get see mozilla code installed pity implementing ldap support later rather sooner could come back bite project harder thought also suprised netscape sun commited people getting ldap support product iplanet sun netscape pushed ldap hard core technology behind large number products yet offer client applications access maybe someone project could call iplanet sun netscape point even pay install messaging solution take full advantage latest client application need use ms product pointing would interest maybe throw people ldap codebase make sure lands later comment interested mozilla pst much hate say mozilla taken seriously organisation larger couple people must support ldap even unit size people ca n t without entire product become unusable without something loose gain ground back later people going move something else staff retrained new system done organisations spend money retraining people mozilla afterwards comment scottputterman pst difference later s extra work land first rewrite address book n t disagree important goal land mozilla would surprised companies choosing use mozilla would want standardize release n t considered finished mozilla s clear ca n t wait couple milestones companies want use addressbook anything useful complaining addressbook s performance landed first goal order makes sense implement work bug considered high priority mail module performance work ll try land soon possible barring anything unexepcted happening comment stewart james pst n t think anyone argue cause work however think surprised howmany companies willing role mozilla prior even netscape ldap address book land previously argued benefit one stalling browser mail client eval waiting land would like take time argue mozilla projects benefit mozilla project obviously much important would also like argue ui development benefit mozilla project patch likely holding back roll mozilla code base either mozilla netscape organizations use ldap organizations using netscape x probably well aware better browsers possibly mail clients like us holding back various reasons us mostly want outlook outlook express rolled netscape x interface aged running along side something like xp even w k makes look worse ui development implementation would mean larger install base projects code base along users using application would offer larger amount feed back user interface maybe fresh idea s things missing people eventually end users comments product give information back mozilla project hopefully end result usable friendly address book features needed example current address book cards inflexible sure users start using address book feedback detail could offered would also like stress understand development view landing ideal solution however patch appeared near landing anyhow part performance wise needs perform similar netscape x better performance would better mozilla code base probably going make ground replacing netscape x cheers stewart james comment dan mosedale dmose

easy ie s start gerv comment todd pringle pdt gerv s idea sounds okay recently changed windows integration dialog straightforward would like make netscape mozilla default browser pref mirrors dialog exactly gets checked answer yes start up dialog would probably good blake think know re big fan prefs comment blake ross pst think problem users finding advanced system panel re understanding use would much prefer see checkbox navigator panel highly visible something simple like use mozilla default browser would check appropriate file extensions system panel course interaction two would weird checking checkbox leaving boxes system unchecked pressing ok comment hixie reading bugmail pst m going assume really really want default browser we case especially one mozilla distributors namely netscape think add checkbox main panels navigator composer mail newsgroups would simply check uncheck relevant things advanced system weirdness would always consistent basically blake s idea think add menu item preferences edit menu app something along lines set default browser set default mailer set default editor item would visible default users would difference users set us default would equivalent shareware application s nag menu items would bring dialog like set default would like set netscape navigator default web browser change default browser settings detail use system panel advanced section preferences dialog open prefs set default cancel mpt kill m sure comment blake ross pst cc ing ui types app improves s likely hopefully people want set default would shame let go

users probably n t want make app default use see enjoy many probably check n t ask many wo n t get see dialog remains problem comment jglick pst agree blake s comment average users likely stay away advanced prefs even somehow manage get advanced system panel probably apparent checking options cause product default browser agree simple use productname default browser application top navigator pref level would best probably users would expect find setting maybe advanced button associated setting allows users customize extensions protocols top level mail pref panel currently use productname default mail application comment peter trudelle pst n t users stay prefs entirely ve heard rule invoked tend believe especially ve got mail account info prefs much personally dislike think still need rely windows integration dialog aggressively ensure users either enable us explicitly indicate n t want also n t want asked anymore settings map simple check make prefs dominant product name works comment blake ross pst honestly n t know lots users reported looking prefs clearing history things agree dialog important thing need improve behavior think simple checkbox navigator panel effective buried advanced panel open prefs would interested seeing stats many users ever open prefs even n t switch panels comment peter trudelle pst reports lots users unusual usual rule thumb users idea newsgroups lurk time much less even mozilla users ever file bug would mean n t really ever hear users unless make effort reach n t issue adding simple top level pref want make sure clear intended solve typical case problem comment blake ross pst yeah know clarified lots users newsgroup personally connection real end users m constantly referring say newsgroups though mean feedback newsgroups consist feedback submissions sent users netscape com form s really technical process help feedback center would n t consider reports highly technical users caveat course users general n t submit feedback comment jglick pst yeah true lots users never touch prefs n t know percentages even fewer submit feedback user aware products prefs specifically trying find setting likely find simple top level checkbox current implementation windows integration stuffs good comment todd pringle pst agree peter need rely mostly windows integration dialog perform function averse adding simpler top level pref navigator place users open hit edit preferences browser m guessing comment hixie reading bugmail pst strong objections proposal menu item edit menu remove default see comment explanation think addition single prefs checkbox per component current advanced prefs panel would effective non intrusive way publicising feature comment matthew paul thomas pst yes object think irritation caused set default browser menu item staring people face whenever chose copy preferences whatever would greater benefit caused mozilla inadvertently lost default browser status especially mozilla distribution

synched registry handle vast majority cases user goes deeper top level prefs possible results make app default b restore previous defaults perhaps consider surfacing ui clearly indicating changing
