changing summary comment bill law pst s deal fix appears must make substantive changes downloading dialog related front end code underlying back end code mozilla uriloader exthandler biggest glitch currently thing store rdf mimetype datasource i e mimetypes rdf file limited set helper applications users adds via navigator helperapplications prefs panel however downloading dialog also appears mime types mapped helper applications via platform specific means e g registry windows internet config mac means place store n t always ask flag must add entries data source least system defined mime type to helper app mappings tricky thing n t necessarily want store mime type helper app mapping reason mapping really defined system one would probably want changes system setting still apply conceptually s hard need record mapping entries data source default continue rely system mapping independent n t always ask flag practice s gets complicated back end code works like simplified greatly call platform dependent implementation docontent method try find helper app mime type platform dependent function calls common xp base class implementation docontent look entry data source fails try find system defined mapping platform dependent manner fails use null helper app requires user specify helper app downloading dialog permit open using option properly handle n t always ask setting logic something like except common xp method return one states rather simply pass fail pass user defined helper app mapping found fail nothing found mime type partial success entry data source n t tell us helper app n t always ask flag either fails partial success get system defined mapping case partial success step overlay n t always ask setting default always ask issues mostly front end issues may impact backend depending choose implement currently front end isolated implementation details rdf helper app data source think try put rdf code updates datasource back end anyway front end issues a think user needs explicitly ask settings given mime type saved automatically presume choice make given instance given content applied future occurrences content think user might get confused example might choose open specific doc file notepad know s really type application ms word get downloading dialog choose notepad say open using next time load doc file uses notepad probably wo n t desired expected behavior think would better give user way say really helper app always want use mime type idea add always use helper app opening files type checkbox open using portion downloading dialog would checked disabled initial display dialog user uses choose button select new helper app checkbox enabled unchecked b issue relates use downloading dialog encounter entirely new content type helper app step logic described case user selects helper app permit user indicate selection used next time encounter content type accomplished using checkbox described a c another issue whether permit user save selection open using vs save disk first setting another like always ask setting must saved pref defined system defined mime type to helper app mappings problem would solved way always ask attribute one issue whether open vs save choice automatically remembered suspect much reason choice helper app ought automatically remembered automatic user needs yet another checkbox tell us remember choice dialog might getting complex m going implement way better suggestion provided d last front end issue full set attributes given mime type to helper app mapping need exposed prefs panel means need reveal always ask setting especially since s means might turned back open vs save setting pref panel supporting dialogs would need add support addition code also need deal separate class entries

communicate mozilla instances ensure always one instance running command line c string sent previous instance wich takes focus maybe simple solution would look like create hidden window known window

window good plan drop dde support entirely comment matthias versen matti pst bug marked duplicate bug comment bill law pst bug marked duplicate bug comment bill law pst bug sucks ve come plan though looking bug prompted think think trick make support dde optional basically use messages via hidden window standard mozilla mozilla ipc mechanism also provide optional dde server third party apps use user able turn dde server via nodde cmd line switch s power users alternative start dde server user specifies dde flag registry key would enable rd party applications rely dde communication mozilla turn monitor use ddeconnect fails determined storing info registry ll try next time least risky strategy would abandon dde server support switch alternative ipc re enable dde server time resources

renominate note triagers important failure fatal anybody identify specific applications block mozilla starting due problem please post help us prioritize things comment timeless pst cost moving dde thread unfortunately s really hard tell directx sound bugs really search windows keyword hang turn bugs think dde test apps somewhere currently real standard way diagnosing problem could create

needs talk mozilla instances transfer control first instance server dde client code mozilla needs removed replaced private communication process dde server registration still needed must done first instance started result mozilla block anymore rd party applications use dde client code ddeconnect call still block seems well kown dde problem comment bill law pdt cool great tip coupling already coded patch use wm_copydata dummy message window solve problem thinking going dde server another thread avoid ddeconnect hang right detect client vs server mode communicate client server via another means mozilla need ever ddeconnect problem solved get back relatively easy code solve problem ll try remember attach patch ve got far soon track comment topics man pdt lots different simplyeways handle first instance later instance thing couple code lines without resorting dde eg use property parented desktop window atom startup app checks whether something appropriate name exists registers use named object mutex procedure either case token eg window handle first instance found purpose passing invokation instance original instance also wm_copydata might overkill latter sorts cross windows platform issues arising past using way ipc doesnt allow receiver return result sender eg new instance cant done reason messages automatically convert lparam visibility receiving process assuming points string course refers start up issues mozilla expose automation functionality apps scripts use either object model exposure nice automation scripting standard ipc far better divorced windowing aspect things unlike dde dde great way ipc back days windows remember correctly personally avoid like plague days hand m much mozilla newbie might talking b cks cheers chris ps note assume mac linux similar constructs use windows terminology comment topics man pdt forgot mention finished first mozilla build wont run dissapears task list without anything visible m using nt sp far know

reasons already stated people worried root installs non root operation right fix follow blizzard s rpms mentioned n t need run mozilla make component reg chrome stuff work need run reg twins auto migrating root s netscape mozilla thereby fetching interpreting network content root wrong m little surprised got past jar since s security hound ages n t optional thing checkbox x migrate communicator x profile mozilla user think backed mozilla tree s wrong approach n t actually solve stated problem seth points comment jim roskind pdt m sure think root s profile migrated running

migrate root s netscape home mozilla comment reading please use seth sspitzer org instead pdt installer poorly named think migrate x profiles comment samir gehani pdt convinced security arguments

someone feels strongly enough need open new bug justifying change security concerns get approval check regarding profile migration could either document installer flag sure many users information

behavior broken case case user root privileges would ok put confirmation dialog normal users normal behavior fine n t believe automigration every run product correct solution let s add work risk around right take smallest fix addresses actual problem comment ben bucksch benb pdt selmer thought main reason bug registration migration mozilla installed root without registration ran user might problems bug comment selmer gone pdt multiple problems described bug original problem installer n t run installer linux component registration root required incorrect certain installs require root user run app install migrate root s profile migrate root s profile non root users get migrated automatically registration happens mozilla users root installer root launching app causes network content loaded suspect may one bug original request run installer address jar s administrator vs normal user distinction fundamental problem comments bug dancing around existing installer behavior predicated run normal non admin user behalf first fix elminate non install portion task run root case component reg etc migration execution product installer launch user executing binary root second fix give root user new flag allows migrate profile alternatively first fix could include dialog asks whether action third fix seth s proposal non root users netscape directory without mozilla directory get installer behavior automatically case unique multiple platforms state directories sufficient distinguish installer case normal run case fourth fix mozilla never migration automatically decided long ago always dialog mozilla builds sounds like may gotten broken linux somehow fixed believe proposals together address many problems described bug comment ben bucksch benb pdt run root case component reg etc migration execution product installer launch user executing binary root seth said installer flag intended migration need registration via regxpcom et al heard see latest comment bug third fix covered bug second fix give root user new flag allows migrate profile somebody indeed use mozilla root regularly n t helping features make work smooth fourth fix mozilla never migration automatically tested last days dialog came peoblem think comment selmer gone pdt ben sorry read suggested implementation comments none intended however disagree statement make life difficult root users simply n t like running app privileges root users believe responsibility make decisions seems remaining fix revolves around handle root users running installer bugs cover problems comment ben bucksch benb pdt selmer m saying make difficult n t work make easy btw iirc x distro freebsd refused run root anyway said second fix give root user new flag allows migrate profile leave installer flag alone root already flag like every user invoke manually seems ok see options create new flag mozilla bin makes registration exits temporary fix reasons stated bug fix right way i e fix bug patch claimed work leave bug alone proposal case current fix backed comment alec flett pdt x claim root freebsd simply true platform to platform policy differences unices current fix breaks users su root would say

image lib longer reading data pipe eventually http blocks trying write data pipe pipe full http channel never propogates onstoprequest s blocked waiting write rest content pipe image lib image lib n t reading data anymore onstoprequest never issued channel stays load group document load group never empty channels turn means never fire load handler document never think done load handler never fires never try load next url benchmark tests image tag whose src really text html fix pretty straightforward consumer http channel returns ns_error_abort response ondataavailable call go ahead cancel

calls ondataavailable ns_error_abort especially since none protocols checking error value s inconsistent http would comment gagan pdt like second patch r gagan comment rpotts gone pdt hey scott sounds

serios comment scott macgregor pdt created attachment details diff review potential hack work around race condition sidebar html comment scott macgregor pdt s potential hack could use marketing cds

stalling windows m test linux windows m pretending n t total hack n t anything better yet still poking comment scott macgregor pdt okay s problem said currently last request document finished fire onenddocumentload using status code associated last request believe incorrect leads problems like seeing last request sometimes image n t exist consider entire document load failure m going assert following correct policy determining status document load entire load group currently canceled definetly want propogate error code end document load get status main document channel use status result

line fix catches problem risk factor patch problems like makes sense comment gagan pdt seems ok would n t want update mstatus cases responsecompleted listener order words move mstatus astatus line outside check maybe even right enter responsecompleted comment scott macgregor pdt thought really good way reduce risk change branch rick thinking wrapping new call doc loader get load group status check perform error condition ns_binding_aborted check would go branch n t correct case zbench errors running come canceled requests images n t exist image tag points html etc check would change current behavior stomp return code specific condition error code ns_binding_aborted cancel case status channel always set correctly change n t open problems like saw late last night certain cases http

status code binding aborted condition idea bother throwing away current status code place load group status entire load iff cancel case channels like http example ran properly setting status channel match status pass onstoprequest call comment rpotts gone pdt ok re right m stupid comment scott macgregor pdt moving back rtm state pdt d like checkin last patch branch per discussion minimizes risk

downloaded files inadvertently deleting file final destination possible solutions could notice user s chosen location pre downloaded location mark file needing deleted quit good several reasons still see pre downloaded file go replace dialog potential security problem downloaded files get put predictable places predictable names better solution would pre download file obscured name like cache directory could even clean file copying final user specified destination rather quit comment sairuh rarely reading bugmail pst henh reminds bug tho one s mac comment scott macgregor pst think part problem regression caused fix bug s bad super reviewed law s change n t catch bug makes helper app dialog modal blocks exthandler s ability process incoming ondataavailable events event queue n t

personally like aesthetics gray message header putting header text area x fasion whatever xul issue gets worked better able copy text head comment hakon pdt also look suggestion bug like give vote comment r k aa pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment christopher w curtis pdt bug reminiscent bug applies alert box text n t know uses toolbar class generic class implemented would allow selet text d happy let bug piggyback ever valid reason disallow selecting text comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt ever valid reason disallow selecting text yes looks _really_ bizarre text ui suddenly selectable consider selectable text menubar instance comment max waterman pdt additional comments bzbarsky mit edu ever valid reason disallow selecting text yes looks _really_ bizarre text ui suddenly selectable consider selectable text menubar instance excellent idea imo text visible selectable find extremely irritating select text error message windows top example often ca n t select error messages windows much simpler would able select text matter displayed perhaps could explain mean bizarre max comment markus gerstel pdt bizarre strikingly unconventional far fetched style appearance odd eccentric freakish freaky flaky outlandish outre want text selectable everywhere application please file different bug comment max waterman pdt additional comments bugzilla uxp de bizarre strikingly unconventional far fetched style appearance odd eccentric freakish freaky flaky outlandish outre want text selectable everywhere application please file different bug would unrealistic point bizarre good enough argument functionality especially case doubly since previous email clients allow selection header items look imo bizarre max comment kai engert kaie pdt saw something neat chatzilla ui doubleclick topic converts edit box mail window header area would read only edit box course edit box changes back static text field soon click somewhere else comment michael lefevre pdt max _all_ text entire ui selectable would bizarre slip mouse might find d selected text menu item button would make users think application falling apart s reason enough said s realistic s desired bits text selectable including message headers n t think anyone saying needed bug bizarre suggestion text ui selectable comment h kan waara pdt firstly let s try keep comments bug relevant useful please comment offtopic right way fix add ad hoc textbox suddenly appear user randomly tries click label n t lots reasons mainly s totally inconsistent usage xul toolkit moving s proposal fix bug mailnews like many email readers could simply embed message headers top message would simple way would also fix bunch bugs current xul message headers speed message loading make text naturally selectable message like text would mentioned consistent email readers also proposal would fix another long standing bug message headers scrollable message like rest text mscott sspitzer jglick others sound like feasible solution comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt proposal interact toggling full header view short header view comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt select directory dialog two things selected mean visually selected eg clicked selected directory pick selected button implies second meaning wording may need improvement clarify default button dismisses dialog reason click open button could also called descend _really_ want confuse users n t want double click directory list want descend comment peter trudelle pdt certainly clarify wording position buttons correctly platforms standard place default buttons comment ian batterbee pdt tend think message header selectable selecting upwards middle message text way makes sense looks like email pasted somewhere else mozilla copies way outlook express static area message message header since microsoft s ui decisions seem please masses maybe allow let user select style want comment ian batterbee pdt anyone considered making currently static area re complaining header shows embedded emails mime sections within main message looks reasonable background colour formatting make obviously message header also part message scrollable selectable alternatively mozilla could go way kmail currently http www theregister co uk media png box within message almost html table selectable course within message containing header info comment ben bucksch benb pdt yes proposed long ago ca n t find generally quite easy implement change url mimetype message loaded msg pane things consider though mainly evolve around fact grey headers msg sandbox renders msg body remote content thus restricted allowed often even js allowed run assuming ll linkify email addresses probably mailto headers context menu add addressbook compose mail could added standard context menu mailto aim menu items netscape might copy email address already part context menu create filter based message possible future reply recipient might problem however since mailto url information msg different versions headers abstact one line version header section probably ca n t implemented way msg sandbox absense js view headers menu item possible though scrollable headers remove much need version attachments attachments box comment ben bucksch benb pdt point like static header bar use standalone msg windows enough vertical space listed problems also show approach potentionally make future features much harder implement mailnews fe developers decide comment kai engert kaie pdt suggestion removing static header looks like big change example also display icons header area visualizing encryption signature status message information known advance message analyzed would mean modify displayed message contents fly think try find simpler solution idea would possible right click menu shown text label containing single menu item copy idea think using view message source acceptable workaround point many users never saw menu item could tooltip header area gives simple hint use view message source copy idea could extend list menu items edit menu could new items copy subject copy message headers also could combined tooltip hint people try use mouse select copy probably would see tooltip message comment timeless pdt kai big problem headers take vertical space available n t scrollable n t s awful concerns um mozilla modifies lots things fly however imo encryption status n t belong headers belongs frame comment jesse houwing pdt maybe collapse headers automatically s enough space really like rightclick copy idea comment kai engert kaie pdt people like right click menu copy on labels implement would great help many places example sometimes ui shows lengthy error messages users want let people know error message currently remember leads communication errors write many users n t want would really cool right click copy would work label ui comment aleksander adamowski pdt vote s wonderful solution globally whole ui would totally wonderful innovative thing seen software comment kai engert kaie pdt clear numbering confusion talking think talking idea comment right click menu copy text labels comment aleksander adamowski pdt yes ve meant comment jan d pdt long right click copy addresses remain copy headers think could work still n t solve non scrolling bug another bug number comment peter trudelle pdt vast majority users n t going discover n t extend well complicates ui unnecessarily using tooltip tell people access dead giveaway ui bad like doors pull handle open push therefore need signs say push people want select headers find normal means selection work use convoluted workarounds comment jesse houwing pdt ca n t use input fields readonly border page info fields parts ui many parts least windows win k ie office corel draw etc comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt wrap see comment _did_ read read whole bug commenting right comment h kan waara pdt totally agree trudelle s comment point bug people want able physically select pieces header information need way select text text document right clicking context menus easter egg tooltips plain way copy select message headers let re iterate benefits putting message headers message belong first place imo message headers selectable normal way message headers scrollable emails many cc recipients finally readable headers wo n t take message pane space think would speed message loading since removed xul headers bloat would make message pane larger default making emails easier read screens sizes response kaie secure message concern could simply make message icon threadpane lock create additional column would indicate message secure would consistent example newsgroups ignored watched headers comment aleksey nogin pdt previous

register mozilla default browswer comment timeless pdt bah foolish mozilla default browser change settings internet control panel x like things way change ignore bug better windows interegration comment lferro pdt duplicate comment timeless pdt nope bug filed reporter slightly different purpose missing dependency tree people could found bug comment blake ross pdt bill s gone comment blake ross pdt usability polish comment jaime rodriguez jr pdt n t touched since july stop ship imho propose move later milestone comment timeless pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment todd pringle pdt actually important part windows xp integration indirectly related xp start menu integration bug bug need make clearer next release believe separate checkboxes nav mail best way go long run low cost solution try get single combined selection i e would like make netscape default browswer email program yes checkbox ask next time start netscape something like saying yes affect behavior described bugs mentioned namely placing nav mail default browser mail section winxp start menu blake busy turbo stuff ccing bill adding nsbranch keyword comment todd pringle pdt adding peter trudelle cc list peter discussed pdt yesterday think really needed light xp start menu integration work re sure blake law busy turbo stuff xp start menu stuff work could find someone work thanks comment peter trudelle pdt law since back blake gone think single combined browser mail prompt would disaster since least users would answer cuz use mail program whereas presumably large percentage would allow browser take default moving nsbranch keywords plussing p comment paul chen pdt taking bill comment todd pringle pdt sounds like talking bill code behind dialog sets default browser email app since case n t time short run combine two effectively simply change wording buttons would like make netscape default browser sounds like implementation smapi mail similar dialog talk one well comment paul chen pdt created attachment details diff review patch use brandshortname windows integration dialog comment paul chen pdt ok patch insert brandshortname initialprompttext prompttext strings ve changed initialprompttext default browser would like make default browser think make prompttext also short sweet suggestions comment todd pringle pdt suggestion netscape currently set default browser would like make default browser yes cancel checkbox default selected ask next time start netscape ccing docs jatin input comment bill law pdt s subtle yet crucial distinction initialprompttext prompttext former asked per installation less might exceptions really asks make default browser latter displayed whenever user s advanced system preferences whack windows registry however user indicated n t want application handle http protocol internet shortcuts question related system s default browser example might related system s default png viewer either need make prompttext generic enhance code ishandlinghttp true uses initialprompttext rather prompttext think doable would much preferred people like say todd comment jaime rodriguez jr pdt pchen trudelle staus pls closing today comment paul chen pdt real issue left text prefs set preferences advanced system file types protocols overridden system say ie dialog text use thatnow windows currently set match windows integration preferences means windows use application open types documents internet shortcuts indicated want update windows match windows integration preferences seems bit long winded cryptic normal users currently application use brandshortname instead m looking better wording comment peter trudelle pdt windows set use netscape open types documents internet shortcuts enabled netscape s windows integration preferences want update windows match netscape settings comment jaime rodriguez jr pdt l n impact pls check paul chen new text todd u ok text paul pls add new strings screen shot michele comment todd pringle pdt paul talked peter bill one s thoughts use default browser dialog initial prompt check opening changes http ftp well n t discuss protocol handlers html file type changed give user default browser text saw initially prompt user instances protocol handlers internet file types changed probably means deselect alert applications change settings checkbox pref panel default bill peter sound right paul bill said thought n t hard based knowledge code think path less l n impact well comment alex bishop pdt set windows open types documents internet shortcuts mozilla however another application changed settings want previous settings restored comment peter trudelle pdt todd yes sounds fine paul bill bug handle comment michele carlson pdt ui changes need checked branch tomorrow s

comment timeless pdt since access key given give alt instead amount use system default _after_ something controls bit awkward comment peter lairo pdt looking screenshot think amount line visible applies scroll lines greyed everywhere congusing makes screen look cluttered possible select scroll lines multiple times different modifiers case amount line appear multiple times amount handle different values modifier case someone wants scroll line ctrl lines alt amount word line took long accidentally realized line scroll lines means s referring lines better would smooth scrolling since jumping lines makes jerkey read follow lines go jumping mousewheel consistency must include word mousewheel modifier ctrl mousewheel alt mousewheel shift mousewheel makes options much clearer comment brian duff pdt thanks feedback ll try incorporate suggestions timeless point access keys well taken ll modify patch system default checkbox always thing controls well beneath justification keeping way sure s easy enough change would prefer field i e _mouse wheel scroll lines use system default _amount peter easy enough change main concern big space drop lists scroll lines selected one s normal reflow controls combo box selections changed space checkbox label field would reserved beneath combo box ll send another screenshot demonstrating ve changed patch possible already patch changing disabling hiding n t change functionality remove lack space see yeah thought scroll lines kind clunky no one objects ll use smooth scrolling suggest wonder might better modifier alt ctrl shift left hand side page already refers mouse wheels twice pretty clear applies added advantage extra horizontal space might make possible add lines label field point comment peter lairo pdt say smooth

wow fast screenshot looks great comments possible make dropdown lists narrow little wider longest entry looks bulky cluttered taking screen space max width affected large small system fonts could rename conrol ctrl calling alt key alternative key preference call keys capital letters alt ctrl shift make easier recognize needs verified ui expert hope use caps modifier keys maybe could add word key e g alt key makes bit clear novices talking key board modifiers may want indent use system default line millimeters right make clear subset line option line maybe words amount lines bit closer box make reading flow bit better bounding box around whole pref inline specify mouswheel behavior seems missing top left corner oops seems prefs dont corner though btw difference system default non system default comment brian duff pdt dropdowns set flex take remaining horizontal space way otherwise width dropdowns would change whenever control group hidden shown right edges dropdowns longer lined properly n t control uh text modifier keys vary platform platform m using entity defined elsewhere words change would change whole mozilla think done might worth logging separate bug m sure else entities used ll add word key back also make drop lists slightly smaller ll try ll try yeah version built cvs seems groupboxes n t think s something m seeing also nightly comment brian duff pdt system

approval comment matthew paul thomas pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment bartosz wucke pdt hey m bit late idea modifier key menu radio checkbox list users could use double bucky modifiers like shift ctrl ctrl alt additional options comment ken harris pdt hmm seems complicated really need ask user whether scroll pixels lines pages the system default d think s os preference anything n t need set mouse wheel speed every application use forget different ways scroll figure re using scrollwheel re scrolling could vastly simplify preference panel something like mouse wheel move back forward history hold option v change text size hold option v x hold control hold shift never comment brian duff pdt hmm os preferences machine allow scroll x lines time one screen time i e roll wheel one notch scroll following number lines time one screen time guess os settings depend mouse driver os combo tend agree use os settings assuming re available except moving backwards forwards changing text size wheel mouse always seemed bit dubious comment kind truncated sentence ui suggested part sentence label part control usually n t translate well least re discouraged kind thing oracle honest m kind tired trying fix ui m starting agree mpt comment comment peter lairo pdt brian latest screenshot comment looks great submitting patch get r sr every day goes buy day users n t understand use useful preference comment ken harris pdt brian re preaching choir ve never used scroll wheel anything scrolling would n t blink eye vaporized panel figured might well suck wacom mouse whose driver intolerable lets choose disabled n lines per notch one page per notch custom keystrokes direction even option reverse wheel s direction configure differently per application including wacom configuration app wacom abomination double shame us re implement copying bad design forcing user set controls twice guess happens set mousewheel scroll pages control panel lines time mozilla prefs point translations well taken simplest solution probably move verbs popup change text size hold option x control shift never give checkboxes never popup modifiers awkward x change text size hold option x control shift added benefit allowing uncheck everything fairly natural action say always scroll already s something s lacking comment screenshot though must admit m mpt camp prefs panel simply n t exist comment peter lairo pdt ken ve never used scroll wheel anything scrolling s fine others use scroll key one purpose e g regularly use ctrl scroll change text zoom also modifiers ctrl alt shift front fixed dropdown items avoid someone selecting modifier twice thus causing logic conflict ps anyone wanting scoll matter modifier is is n t pressed could simply set dropdowns scroll specified number lines comment brian duff pdt d like clear bug get consensus please vote either yay nay last patch screenshot comment comment yays win ll check works latest nightly set getting r sr comment ken harris pdt nay probably could guess s ok people really need control wheel zoom let s make control wheel zoom n t mean need preference panel keyboard shortcuts zooming n t preference panel changing somebody goes files bug keyboard shortcuts remappable prefs panel ll go hang d much rather control wheel zoom everywhere yet another preference apple adobe microsoft etc want make control alt shift special things n t make user decide one goes pick something reasonable go thanks sit front adobe product computer world know option drag means make copy fact _only_ defense see particular preference something like opera uses modifier keys one way internet explorer uses modifier keys way n t want kill half potential users motor memory laudable goal case mozilla exactly one mousewheel preference mousewheel mozilla use mozilla s defaults opera s behavior explorer s behavior setting control wheel zoom in out alt wheel navigates history better yet one programs good convention use n t even mozilla specific defaults either way say re making easy people migrate mozilla allowing forcing configure combination reminds mpt s bug comment looks unprofessional d ever set modifiers zoom

window opendialog chrome global content filepicker xul ability implement nsifilepicker show via native platform dialog would lost find clients code window opendialog chrome global content filedialog xul impose similar limitation also makes difficult use alternative find dialog even one implemented xul js s find dialog structured way like nsifilepicker use xpcom seperate implementation dialog clients standard mozilla practice believe separate components communicate using xpcom interfaces even honored breach context much front end code one consequence use xpcom course ability implement interfaces one s choice language find component happens implemented c option time another consequence using xpcom one modify implementation component without impact knowledge clients use component think nsifindcomponent succeeded despite whatever churn occurred dialog implementation clients oblivious s good thing bad one given m sure current situation cause concern n t say nsifindcomponent n t problems think expressed terms interface methods choice implementation language limitations implementation add new api text searching embedding order get away code ui coupling m sure new api necessary relatively simple nsifindcomponent stands call findnext rather find difficulty might would still unreachable code called nsidomwindowinternal opendialog chrome url suspect could remedied tweaking

thread pane presses tab ctrl tab uses one single letter next prev message keys comment alec flett pst actually thinking extending thread pane thing message pane message finishes loading focus goes message pane space would auto scroll message comment akkana peck pst would solve spacebar issue would tab back thread pane wanted arrow up down sure would bother people maybe people would like better arrows scrolled message could n t spacebar thread pane bound scroll message message pane seems like would easier way fixing spacebar bug without shift focus would n t worry spacebar maybe scrolling clicked header comment ninoschka baca pst m sure default startup behavior basically like x implementation messages selected various folders observed using x imap account startup inbox surrounded

central page two ways tell many messages present folders first tiresome way scrub folder pane mouse wait tooltips appear folder name second easier way focus folder pane select folder one one e g using arrow keys inspect contents thread pane status bar mozilla constantly push user thread pane trying making press shift tab tab twice get back folder pane every time rather obnoxious think one situation entire mozilla suite mozilla move focus one visible element another visible element window without consent user n t aaron s jennifer s comments rather orthogonal bug focus issue keyboard shortcut issue comment jon granrose pdt mpt said switch x home x work win se reason folder counts n t get updated correctly switch back forth end click folder pane use arrow keys go folder update message count know folders unread messages x easy click arrow every folder x pain since click folder focus goes back thread pane every click annoying especially due speed x n t x feature parity issue comment alec flett pdt intended behavior time folder loaded want arrow keys navigate thread pane comment ninoschka baca pdt mouse users make sense say majority time user want focus thread pane keyboard users would

folder update mesg count folder check new messages folder delay would something like second folder message count updated comment jesse ruderman pdt n t like delay idea delay would considerably longer second allow see whether s anything worth reading folder feature becomes less useful mouse users wait use arrow keys scroll thread pane also many users wonder focus moved thread pane black ring moved re familiar idea focus even though n t touched anything second comment reading please use seth sspitzer org instead pdt another idea might already suggested m sure possible user uses mouse select folder automatically select folder example inbox startup switch focus thread pane user using keys n t switch focus figure using keys n t want focus jump comments comment h kan waara pdt support last suggestion sounds reasonable comment alec flett pdt abstracting keyboard input m imagining something onkeydown record bit like keyboard use state folder changes onkeyup event onselect event happen comment kmurray pdt detect key state vs mouse click sounds reasonable n t like idea delay trying presume threshold comfortable expected behavior predict keys vs mouse variables around perceived delay
