pushed edge window comments preferences option comment martin pdt option two looks cleaner s bit strangely phrased though assuming re configuring startup show blank says display navigator starts blank page perhaps reversed order drop box radio button values like show a blank page x navigator starts new tab opens new window opens drop box would values blank home last visited event later additions pref example custom page could add custom drop down box without reconfigure rest ui selecting custom page could bring separate input box asking uri course makes sense english arranging ui like might make sense languages even english s still bit clumsy ui purposes n t feel like reversing values drop box radio buttons could leave radio buttons blank home last visited change top part read new

tabs open want open n t want tabs open would closed right hell mozilla think trashing tabs user clearly wants open gotten accustomed reading one tab group second loads background closing tabs finish get two three tabs left time start next tabgroup unfortunately firebird open new window every tab group forced use multiple windows kind ruins whole point tabbed browser comment brian mathis pdt dataloss data lost n t necessarily data s forms web pages might loaded though could s data tabs hold specifically pages m looking at want look working right data let s honest mere fact one uses tabs lazy putting reading something leaving later wanted remember pages wanted read later would instead using tabs tabs allows web browser remember n t current functionality dataloss specifically look tab bar tabs n t looked yet gone get back remember n t want lazy s whole reason use tabs comment daniel bratell pdt usability study ve learned users find confusing bookmark groups open additional tabs instead replacing existing set tabs possible read usability study maybe interpreted way new thing replacing tabs n t seem reach optimum usability either comment david crick pdt m another supporter keeping original append behaviour worst must preference config re enable go crazy new route m fairly long term mozilla user since x miffed load background tab behaviour changed recent removal close tabs thankfully added back tried firebird miffed opening tabgroup lost opening page although m beginning wonder new method certainly inkling back may able used oh firebird also lacks close tabs amazes wording original messages could still full steam ahead get it into the final release ve suddenly got change ui first time however many releases s close tabs new weird behaviour plus inability close tabs well irritations two major reasons m using firebird right hoped able stick mozilla suite last minute change prior final release leaves stunned back lynx guess comment serge gautherie sgautherie pdt yet another example wanting tabs remain every morning starting mozilla open group webmail tabs sure want thoses tabs stay whole day whatever else meantime including opening groupmarks note theses sites server session maintained loose tabs point loose ability close session security issue case also applies private sites including banking b b activities etc comment pascal chevrel pascalc pdt ve using new feature days give chance sorry surfing painful time needed open groupmark afterwards coming back previous tabs reach seconds second main groupmark tabs clicking back button means individual tab irritating blinking effect closed front previous tabs opened big big speed regression tab users clear usability study done people never used tabbed browsing still think one browser per page also problems twice back button disables visiting hotmail com third ploblem new browsing behaviour producing memory leaks open page click groupmark click back forward task manager open back forward operation see memory use rising kb previous appending method n t happen since n t go back forth saying memory leak bug caused new replace method probabky emphasizes current memory leak back forward close tab comment david crick pdt horribly horribly wrong firstly nightly ve tried a exactly i e alpha new idea go irrespective bad points m mention feature final pulled immediately much change final indeed final mozilla suite version even aside terrible new behaviour introduces btw tabbed browser things differently mozilla mozilla crowd going magical ui mystery tour two biggest gripes come visual data loss information tabs replaced old ones disappear completely s new tabs loaded back button becomes active drop down reads group tabs re paying attention visually tabs gone new group soon follow link back button option old group removed i e old tabs really gone ai n t getting em back point alone enough convince bad thing new feature optional experimental old behaviour default correct one use windows machine internet explorer find open link new window time screen soon becomes cluttered within new windows ve given particularly prevalent m using search engine start opening links pages returned m scrolling results page waiting load background keep reading results ll say go read first typically set pages click next pull next set results mozilla perfect use tabs load search result new tab easily becomes impossible open new window ie look closing irrelevant tabs leaving useful tabs open maybe ll open tabs next set search results eliminate ll also following links within pages ve opened also using new tabs explore areas within sites end result search engine first tab perhaps useful pages left open remaining tabs typical useful completely undoable new behaviour others also stated loading sets tabs background future reading keeping set tabs always available also typical browsing behaviours think back comments new method new window type behaviour possibly stems users simply n t understand tabs additional optional behaviour sure add must n t default indeed behaviour especially reiterate new behaviour confusing visually new behaviour loses previously opened sets pages new behaviour prevents existing usage techniques comment serge gautherie sgautherie pdt feedback users studied would n t happier pref behaviour like open groupmarks new window comment eric

ca n t believe missed bug since follow almost every tabbed browser behaviour bug s also suprising n t linked way tab group bugs ve filed and or already follow marking dependencies comment bob rusbasan pdt know matter opinion thought huge step forward changed append instead replace really find hard believe many people disagree doubts usability study perhaps n t take account sometimes advanced features take little getting used d hate see major negative change like made permanent unknown group users little bit initial confusion well may liked better way given little time using saying d prefer replace append additionally notice seem speaking theoretical sense preferring appending seem speaking experience also hate change functionality back button go back single page ve loaded new tabs loaded new page one hit back page get old tabs back hit back ve restored one tab first page loaded new tabs hit back get old tabs re looking different tab one back restore old tabs combining single page behavior all tabs behavior one control back button tell confusing anybody usability tested highly doubt people find confusing one vote big big mistake especially given firebird eliminating scores options keep things simple re going force people one way append easily figure close extra tabs way replacing confusing stuff disappeared back button intuitive bottom line one way consistent uses simple user interface metaphors extra tabs added back works single page way may avoid extra tabs users might expect get used makes complete mess things rules back button people able understand horrible comment jason bassford pdt saying d prefer replace append people object something vocal believe lot people prefer replace n t commented prefer experience thankfully n t really chimed yet

notion groupmark history addition currently merged page history personal feeling concerning change find disturbing annoying users want however condition s kind preference setting right prefer old behavior m wondering whether put go back works ok comment hermann schwab pdt bugs blocking list partly causing data loss caused new behaviour enhancement would implemented conditionally bugs would taken people preferring new behaviour missing one powerful features tabbed browsing loading groups additionally please fix bug according summary line make new behaviour conditionally comment eliot lear pdt regards comment might one consider bit abuse bug system bit disengenuous filed bugs behavior one would sufficed comment jason bassford pdt filed bugs behavior one would sufficed behaviour n t dependent bug clearly different specific problem fact fixing one fix n t preclude possibility fixing one without fixing rest comment greg pdt please make new behaviour closing existing tabs option comment jack eidsness pdt kind ridiculous never seen code written deliberately favor data loss irreversible closing tabs problem add warning closing window damage opening bookmark reason easy see people feel many tabs open already way close tabs dont want ca n t even use bookmark group never less tabs open rarely aware tabs invention called computer track stuff bug fix decision completely opposite philosophy someone wants tabbed browser many options tabs available may confusing simple way getting un confused one going bookmark bunch tabs n t even know tab find mysterious bookmark tabs opened undo closing arbitrary large number tabs using mozilla windows u winnt en us rv b gecko lost ton tabs extremely confusing also suggest n t want add new option preferences terribly obscure hook load links background option anyone likes load links background probably also likes bookmarks add tabs rather subtract please forgive ca n t read m work need figure ve past hour opening bookmark

prognathous hotmail com please remove flags set drivers resetting minus flag set asa comment derek ross pdt problem new tab behavior discards metaphor underlies process tabbed browsing imho tabbed browsing functionally identical act opening pages new windows fact bad old days tb would always open pages new windows minimize window let load background advent tabs allowed thing reducing clutter apps windows taskbar extending metaphor group tabs s easy equate opening groupmark opening list urls new windows also new windows n t active back buttons reason tabs reason m pointing may better way reduce novice confusion without revamping whole tabbed browsing scheme perhaps users confused n t understand tb supposed alternative opening links new windows alternative functionally identical yet different appearance proposal could provide option produces visual tabbed browsing interface self explanatory novices specific tabs moved top browser bottom part also tabs visually changed manilla folder like tabs buttons similar appearance ones would see windows taskbar tabs adjacent visually similar windows taskbar would much easier novices develop intuition s going tabbed browsing course would preferable interface option pref derek ross comment jason bassford pdt tabs moved top browser bottom part suggestion nothing bug see bug imho tabbed browsing functionally identical act opening pages new windows yes others differing opinions hence summary bug conditionally replacing tabs s already establishd need conditional everybody either submit patch wait somebody else know issues s reason simply repeat on topic comment could approach problem simply port firebird preference browser tabs loadfolderandreplace n t exist mozilla default setting and or existence preference ui could discussed later comment eliot lear pdt one things concerned coupling home button bookmarks may case tight may want one behavior bookmark another click home button especially regard tabs people think

previous message totally inappropriate patch bug one added feature back button go previous group tabs working m using mozilla windows u winnt en us rv b gecko clicking groupmark back button lights gray stays lit tabs loading background click back menu attached back button appears empty tiny square textless menu ever finish loading back menu longer empty otherwise option go back previous group tabs soon click link switch tabs etc back button go gray subsequently light without previous group tabs went new page seems exception rather rule back previous group tabs option available found one situation get back button go previous group tabs stay focused tab click nothing tabs loaded one bug thats long time naturally would still prefer appending tabs rather replacing regardless opinion back button s new feature n t find way show sooner go away later would recommend rolling back previous behavior appending tabs n t make sense try use replace behavior without dependable way go back comment

like one opens one bookmark replaces current page modifyer ctrl used append existing tabs poweruser behavior imo suggest wontfix restore replace behavior file new bug modifier to append behavior kiss comment jason bassford pdt suggest wontfix restore replace behavior original previous behaviour append replace replace bug introduced may th resolving wontfix would likely involve backing patch s

sucks hate replace feature passion append much nicer want lose currently open tabs click bookmark tabs also currently implemented feature work style browsing click bookmark tabs go opening new tabs closing end ca n t go back anymore last tab remaining lose access everything already open please change back append behavior least get option ui set comment vaclav dvorak pdt please forgive adding spam could someone tell status waiting decision waiting someone contribute patch kind patch would chance accepted s little bit many comments read re could add info status whiteboard benefit others ll thanks record hate new behaviour replacing existing tabs d prefer replace current tab add tabs group new tabs n t really care exactly added previous behaviour adding tabs new fine comment jason bassford pdt bug waiting patch kind technical discussion spam n t helping way almost everything said already said comments add nothing towards solution see two technical solutions could accepted implicit behaviour modification along lines replace tabs regular click append tabs ctl click single tabs solution would take account bookmarks appear bookmarks menu fashion currenly allow regular left

ere maijala slow pdt seems problem causes mark read filter harm good comment mike cowperthwaite pdt note recent comment bug stating patch pending bug also addresses symptom one comment david bienvenu pst taking comment mike cowperthwaite pst part implementation bug s fix incoming mail identified junk loses new flag perhaps necessary prevent notification note per bug message filtered mark read moved loses new flag inbox case even without green arrow message mozilla puts notification necessary clear new status prevent notification seem two ways could go message marked read filter loses new flag includes filtering delete message specific filter action could added clear new status suppress notification bug first method implemented probably preference automatic like no notify on junk suspect tho preference coarse technique real use think cases someone might want notification least want green arrow mail s marked read ideally would best suppress notification without losing green arrow message folder green arrow account seems directly tied notification see bug comment mike cowperthwaite pst bug marked duplicate bug comment mike cowperthwaite pst bug marked duplicate bug comment s myles prather pst wish could use votes one bug s really driving nuts sys admin bunch scripts sends warnings day n t concern ca n t mark junk want filter trash marked read never even know happened ca n t work minutes time without biff popping due one trash mails context switch mail find trash folder bold text nothing inbox arggg comment david bienvenu pst created attachment details

comment david bienvenu pst created attachment details diff review imap fix comment david bienvenu pst fixed trunk one remaining problem imap messages deleted filters end unread trash folder trash folder inbox look like new mail biff fire fix involve marking imap msg read moving trash folder pretending ve marked read code removed maybe need restore code even though means unread count trash wrong comment jonas sicking sicking pst would n t better let biff notification ignore new messages trashcan rather mess newmessages count trashcan sounds like would consistent logical ui would user see messages trashcan got automatically moved let him her go emptying trashcan comment david bienvenu pst ignoring trash first solution occurred easiest one well m leaning towards comment robert accettura raccettura pst d suggest possibly make option filter ui notify filter triggers people use spamassassin filter move suspected spam junk folder obviously n t want fire filtered think might better solution long run would much flexible people turn notifications things n t want long run m sure would create filter turn notification mailing lists subject contains forum reply move forum mail n t notify bugzilla mail would cover everyone comment jonas sicking sicking pst robert sounds cool also sounds like compleatly new request comment robert accettura raccettura pst reply comment robert

threads think one menu item n t change sort order called user actually wants sort order received option still present menu design would eliminate threaded view messages move thread sortby submenu separate menu group threaded currently bottom submenu would also move order received end first menu group otherwise reorder put more likely used sort orders top i e date subject sender recipient priority label size flag read reply status currently status junk status order received threaded note selecting option view threads submenu also selects order received sort criterion undecided whether menu items also maintain whatever sort order previously selected comment mike cowperthwaite pdt note since selecting sort by thread sets selection criterion order received thread item submenu checked except carryover profile created earlier version mozilla reason move among rest items submenu also case n t clear original report would expect sort thread item behave current messages threaded item checked rather radio item affect sort criterion comment peter lairo pdt like ideas bug message threading currently mess m sure threaded item moved view messages view sortby threaded status yes no s sort criteria sort order state called threaded also maybe menu item view threads grayed view messages threaded de selected btw stil miss ability able click collumn headers threaded subject sender date etc separately turn on off threading sort independently mentioned bug comment comment mike cowperthwaite pdt m sure threaded item moved view messages view sortby threaded status yes no s sort criteria sort order state called threaded noted original bug expected make objection noted threading akin sorting filtering view messages view threads menus controlling threading bunch messages fact sorting groups altho sort ordered ascending descending also since thread column three pane argued bug toggle flat threaded makes sense corresponding menu item grouped items corresponding column headers also maybe menu item view threads grayed view messages threaded de selected would selecting particular thread filter becomes two step process comment peter lairo pdt threading akin sorting filtering view messages view threads menus controlling fine however listed view sort separated sort criteria dividing line similar ascending descending items look something like one preference c a b c view sort x threaded date date flag flag date order received order received flag order received x threaded ascending o descending ascending ascending o descending o descending x threaded would gray view threads selecting particular thread filter becomes two step process would still gray otherwise selecting item could cause possibly unselected threaed item another submenu change state also cause unselected threaded state change state would confusing view threads selection nothing case minor issue imo ps want able click threaded sorting collumn headers separately clicking thread state affect sorting clicking sorted state affect thread state would look act like initial example state threaded subject sender date size click date collumn threaded subject sender date size click thread state collumn unthreaded subject sender date size click sender collumn unthreaded subject sender date size click thread state collumn threaded subject sender date size click sender collumn threaded subject sender

comment stefan borggraefe pst seems general consent removal view sort by thread agree think menu item view messages x threaded replaced two new menu items sort menu descending threaded flat reasons like ascending descending threaded additonal property search criteria except thread another reason remove threaded moved messages menu identical view dropdown pane gain consistency think option clear user alternative flat written ascending could menu item checkmark n t reason think mike pretty much idea except additional idea two radio menu items threaded flat furthermore think menu items threads menu n t change threaded option already true menu items submenu except threads unread watched threads unread confused discussion far perhaps move aspect ideas stated bug bugs concentrate removal sort by thread movement threaded bug make easier handle discussion comment greg colyer pst would even like ascending descending flat instead unthreaded comment mike cowperthwaite pst think changing threaded single check item dual radio items perfectly fine per stefan s comment realize view threads unread view threads all affect threadedness fact thought turning threading somehow disabled view

completely useless permanent sort order people always want flagged messages reminders also want newest messages view see new messages new messages propose sort order sort flag changed flagged newest oldest flagged newest oldest reverse either way placing flagged messages next newest unflagged messages reproducible always steps reproduce comment r k aa pst bug marked duplicate comment lisa pst n t think two bugs asking ability use multiple sort criteria dup m saying sorting flag behave differently right n t think current sort flag logical since appears trying also take date account counterintuitive way comment mike cowperthwaite pst s actually date order received secondary sort criterion see difference creating folder copying messages ad hoc fashion order received order placed folder typically especially inbox date order close sounds like would like see ascending descending ordering flag reverse particular desired use flags would work right sorted flags ascending implied secondary criterion order received ascending might break someone else s current use sort by flag making order specifiable seems fair amount work little gain multiple sort criteria would allow specify first sort flags ascending date descending perhaps even nicer first sort label ascending date descending comment lisa pst m multiple sort criteria m actually think request different get separate consideration could think good reason sort flag way would n t bothered bug ca n t think proposed method seems logical simply good m also one finds sort method illogical could people n t speaking change simply sort flag commonly used however n t heard anyone say like current method people want use sort flag unhappy method s harm changing far ve heard change n t think s good enough reason least consider change comment grey hodge jx pst bug fixed multiple sort criteria would resolve bunch thse types bugs suckup s excellent suggestion though suckup bug marked duplicate comment mike

newest important messages bottom see also bug comment mike cowperthwaite pst confirming see also bug comment charles oliver nutter pdt ve added vote bug agree current sort order sorting flags totally worthless n t think anyone would choose sort flags intending flagged messages go least significant end list next oldest messages lisa right think also qualifies bug rather rfe mail client ve used sorts flags way s totally counter intuitive least none outlook series novell s groupwise series work way comment marat khalili pdt also voted bug however think flag read date read read flag date way modes sensible telling request duplicate multiple sort please apply arguments saved flag date thread obviously neither unread flagged messages ever buried please tell think s always true comment charles oliver nutter pdt disagree comment sorts also take read consideration unless sorting read sorting flag different sorts consider date automatically though flag sorts consider flag date correctly appropriate multiple sort criteria supported however think automatically sorting date explicitly stated i e instead saying sort subject say sort subject date comment mike cowperthwaite pdt

thanks experimenting comment r navalinskas pdt ok ll try starting situation single maximized browser window clicking say image opens new window pingu throw game yetisports com opens new window almost

screen fact probably wo n t notice normally browse maximized window website opens new window fixed size position specified new window positioned toward bottom screen potentially partially offscreen situation came n t know perhaps visited site attempted open invisible popunder window mozilla made visible making small toward bottom right screen brought comment circumstances could possibly become

address almost expected size issue still n t understand bug also related centering new unmaximized window opened maximized browser wo n t security reasons makes easy unscrupulous site hide small

screen fully seen appears smaller size words contents lower part seen functionality buttons etc pingu throw game reachable seen similar bugs past like warning dialog windows small buttons seen give idea m talking comment dan pdt new window s initial position entirely onscreen patch bug may still show unexpected places especially use maximized browser whose last unmaximized position toward one corners least new window entirely onscreen patch explicitly address sizing error commentd ca n t reproduce n t understand could happen however sizing code also rewritten alongside positioning code perhaps s fixed m closing bug fixed since primary complaint positioning error arising combination unfortunate restored browser window position positioning code glitch claim fixed r navalinskas agree

supports replacement variables suggested configapps readme tested seamonkey trunk build without mailnews chatzilla works fine news snews mailto irc schemes someone test remaining http ftp schemes thunderbird especially sure getpath really gives path including filename getfilepath recognized patch would suggest following text configapps n t change application application url scheme web browser http email mailto newsgroups news snews ftp ftp irc irc replacement variable url server address including scheme dir everything used application types urls web browsers ftp applications follow general template ftp username password host port path instead ftp also http use hence applications support replacements username username authentication password password authentication host server address port tcp ip port server path path file including filename email variable used email email address link usenet news urls take three basic forms news group news host group news msgid news could also replaced snews encrypted news feeds applications hence support variables group group name host server name msgid message id irc url usually takes form like irc server channel apps support variable addition full url host server name channel name irc channel comment aaron lawrence pdt put readme s need change application say arguably would nicer online help guide telling put parameters programs

clearly big regression n t even ship beta one dig solution quite soon comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt question get header way get underlying channel imgirequest though pointer thing m little

least ll reasonable extension darin biesi thoughts comment marcel b pst even cgi generated pointing straight image causing address bar show image filename still wants save image cgi filename htm user

vote filetype assumed saving n t seem like good idea parse file header result available elsewhere note ie particular case also unable save properly cgi img tag saves image pic jpg close quite whereas cgi address bar replaced jpg mozilla reverts back untitled bmp comment robert kaiser kairo mozilla com pst reply comment even element properties dialog shows correct filename location field contents

params filename even element properties dialog shows correct filename location field note url bar post redirect uri s element properties thing treating image uri s uses since save image goes based actual link image final uri redirects gunk n t information able pic jpg much simpler able content disposition filename comment marcel b pst right misinterpreted alt text sorry supposed know one random server params filename re say address bar contains post redirect uri filename longer parameter case never mind since save image goes based actual link image final uri redirects gunk n t information perhaps final uri bit likely contain actual filename initial link able pic jpg much simpler able content disposition filename yes pic jpg would great start users save one pic gallery would love full

271929,Build Config,nobody,Remove config build list pl config purge old headers pl headerlist build process remove perl scripts config build list pl config purge old headers pl temporary headerlist build process scripts originate bug comment following purpose header header h moved module_ module_ build system ensure copy dist include module_ header h removed current build cycle works follows initially headerlist dist include module_ effectively marking files dist include module_ deletion build encountered headers module_ including resulting idl files nsinstalled dist build list pl adds corresponding filenames dist include module_ headerlist finally purge old headers pl removes files dist include module_ marked headerlist also removes headerlist summary headers nsinstalled removed thus build procedure substantially simplified initially run rm rf dist include nsinstall encountered headers dist include module_ comment hans andreas engel pst created attachment details diff review dist include use config build list pl config purge old headers pl headerlist implying also cvs remove config purge old headers pl note config build list pl still needed build list libraries comment christian biesinger n t email ping irc pst nsinstall preserve timestamp h files otherwise suspect triggere full rebuild make would undesirable comment hans andreas engel pst thank commenting quickly completely agree full rebuild must tolerated however think full rebuilds triggered proposed patch since current build system avoids full rebuilds compare cases already header dist include current code case header deleted proposed code far understood nsinstall basically runs two different modes nsinstall run copy mode already file dist directory removed copying http bonsai mozilla org cvsblame cgi file mozilla config nsinstall c rev root cvsroot current proposed code create new file difference mtime handling performance ii symlink mode nsinstall keeps symlink already exists current code otherwise new link created proposed code http bonsai mozilla org cvsblame cgi file mozilla config nsinstall c rev root cvsroot http bonsai mozilla org cvsblame cgi file mozilla config nsinstall c rev root cvsroot since make mtime link target relevant difference current proposed code regarding performance cost readlink current vs symlink new thus think additional rebuilds performance nsinstall significantly decreased leading overall faster compilation since perl scripts run comment cls pst iirc old nmake build system win used makecopy exe preserve timestamps removing dist include would cause full rebuild s longer case problem see rm rf solution erase everything dist include rather headers directories headerlist s big deal in tree modules applications build top tree may problem since dist include longer preserved build cycles comment hans andreas engel pst see building application top mozilla make application make mozilla would ok however dist include would incomplete one must use make mozilla make application successful build complete dist include similarly lone make mozilla would bad lone make application fine ps cls thank historical background comment benjamin smedberg bsmedberg pst inclined wontfix bug n t particularly like headerlist files think rm rf dist include worse affect build on top applications reason build simplification perhaps small time savings comment hans andreas engel pst bsmedberg could please explain rm rf dist include affects build on top applications give shell build commands e g configure app make make would broken current patch would helpful regarding future efforts dealing headerlists main reason bug indeed build simplification since current build system uses several somewhat obscure non standard mechanisms think simplifications good however realistic scenario would badly broken patch would strongly support wontfixing bug comment hans andreas engel pst currently seems little interest issue bsd written n t want change build system point unless definite benefit provided think great benefit would result reducing complexity mozilla s build system since would significantly reduce entry barrier tinkering mozilla however proposed change small step direction benefit proposed solutions small agree issue low priority consequently follow comment mark bug wontfix please reopen resources reviewing become available comment benjamin smedberg bsmedberg pst ok ve decided go ahead ll watching tinderbox cycle times see whether significantly hurts build time comment benjamin smedberg bsmedberg pst landed trunk comment darin fisher pst whatever reason patch correct win builds constantly ending horked states patch reason dist include getting rebuilt correctly manually make export various subdirectories order get build
