mike gebis pst right clicking bookmark group personal toolbar brings menu includes option open new window using option n t would expect instead opening new window populating appropriate tabs opens manage bookmarks window actually play around several right click menu options seem problems expand seems nothing new folder seems nothing probably unrelated bookmark groups though since nothing

interpreted m trying note file group ui dialog let explain little detail think already understand asked wan na write little better offer ideas comments fix explaining detail tab page browser open file bookmark dialog first time want adjust window new size like based root level bookmark view adjust hit ok x persist size upon reuse open new tab want file new bookmark either tab hit file dialog opens default size think step persisted last instance saying buttons dialog re adding lines top reason choosing default size n t garbled question way remove amount create folder box space buttons adding lines top time solution size could persisted globably adjust needed much like ui items mozilla problem last patch close open tabs original non group folder ui dialog persist size adjusted step one come default size filing lot bookmarks always tabs shows group folder ui dialog happens default size every time even adjust persisting size adjusted gets real annoying solution believe re saying probably possible persist dialog size instead reseting everytime adding height width attributes would also good solution could create seperate persisted size based upon added ui checkbox dialog state saving two sizes tab tabs solution guess another solution maybe move ok cancel buttons right side new folder default buttons d like see changed bug close rest works fine use n t matter decide fix d like see bookmark folders root level fairly long need file bookmark d like persist size everytime opens matter tab dont go crazy resize window everytime file new bookmark find folder wan na create

mozillas version since final static binary platform one final symbol given name example say third party app uses expat utf mode decide add browser component via mozilla take advantage static linkage savings would recode use expat ucs mode since mozilla uses mode maybe third party parts could use namespaces scope uniquely within mozilla otherwise probably take kinda macros redefine apis static whild building mozilla n t leak thru mozilla headers embedder n t pickup macros mistake comment hacker formerly known seawood netscape com pst already support using system version rd party libraries

standard signature particular release in tree versions libraries n t using standard signature need fix imo resolving library dependency problems application ultimately responsibility embedder embedders may want take penalty multiple copies libraries right use single instance library telling build system build in tree version scoping world forced take penalty maintenance penalty changing

122121,General,mozilla,BeOS gfx implementation extremely slow major problems include following creating destroying bbitmaps every time blit copying platform independent bits bbitmaps every time blit using b_op_alpha even alpha channel present excessive locking drawing currently twice around every primitive excessive calls sync resulting huge slowdown particularly tiling unneeded drawing bbitmap data drawtoimage forth m filing bug assigning patch currently testing addresses attach bug next week comment daniel switkin pst accepting bug adding perf keyword setting milestone hopefully sooner comment daniel switkin pst created attachment details diff review patch patch fixes problems reported original bug description plus following added drawnolock method used drawtile calls prevent locking synchronizing server iteration fixed several warnings massive code cleanup commenting rewrote createimage completely since bit case matters removed non working cruft related b_cmap bbitmaps

lock may rewritten bit e g surface lock moffscreen mbitmap lock else view locklooper also moving locking surface definitely helps avoid nested locking inspite debug code nver noticed lockcount higher tried ask bedevtalk reality means call bview locklooper view attached bbitmap nobody answered sure though p s n t afraid adding extra code growing stack size case even little speed addition counts current situation comment sergei dolgov pst explicit rule recall minimize code inside lock question e g adjusted text drawing happens word word better lock view finish whole frame long time lock single locks inside loop allowing probably time windows activity short time multiple locks comment simon pst would say much better lock especially drawing offscreen view looper n t need unlocked handle mouse messages things also read somewhere getwidth stuff returns afontid speed rendering could something else add gfx implementation comment sergei dolgov pst m bit confused concentration locking issue think comment found code locking overestimates situation usually mozilla compiled double buffering means drawing primitives called least page layout rendering views attached bbitmap bwindow bbitmap needs locked view attached child performs drawing bbitmap lock n t lock application window little uncertainity object lock bview locklooper view added bbitmap asked bedevtalk nobody

needs locked view attached child performs drawing bbitmap lock n t lock application window quote exactly real need ever unlocked rendering window messages process primitive drawn bbitmap via child bview calls lock unlock think adds serious overhead m concerned locking stuff beos one fastest moz platforms much faster linux x server round triping nowhere fast major platforms major difference beos

bbitmap lock explicitly quote bebook bbitmap lock bbitmap unlock functions lock unlock off screen window bviews associated bbitmap draw locking works window views ordinary on screen windows far appserver concerned bview bbitmap parent still draws window even though s offscreen still needs locked probably adds overhead locking normal window called around every word page maybe thousand times lot overhead m concerned nested lock calls number times lock unlock happens comment daniel switkin pst actually beos inherently slower windows two reasons drawing done graphics server another process app_server n t nearly much hardware acceleration remember offscreen drawing beos done completely software windows load offscreen onto graphics card drawing hardware although n t know mozilla windows port takes advantage however agree locking imposing overhead would n t believe much work locking looper could improve comment sergei dolgov pst ok daniel locklooper may really complex intelligent method additional work atomizing safety far understand direct usage bbitmap lock second thought think possibility use bdirectwindow notice bebook n t work cards really doubt bezill ais usable machines using cards comment sergei dolgov pst btw resource wasting locking sense thing double buffered page layout rendering picture animation frame update image performs lock good one even reduce overhead copying changed part image comment daniel switkin pst locking bitmap view attached cheap m sure locking using view therefore another server thread using direct window interesting idea major problem lose copybits process without hardware accelerated screen to screen blit copybits scrolling unusable tried current code base work around iframe scrolling problems deadly slow ghz athlon therefore

text typing letter mozilla calls fillrect times like fillr fillr fillr fillr fillr fillr onscreen mode means real locking even apply technique proposed fact mozilla pushes whole text proceeds full frame reflow even add single letter end text competence thing investigate weird values width height fillrect like fillr width height comment sergei dolgov pst wwidget worst design mozilla seems url

understand uses current behaviour think s reasonable assertion escaping behaviour right thing people time would thought could knock bookmarklet gave text box type nscrt h right thing gerv comment

although d say original quote correctly new value different letter thing avoid obvious class user error gerv comment chris lyon pst bug marked duplicate bug comment jesse ruderman pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment jesse ruderman pdt escaping would n t fix problem keyword bookmarklets ones http www squarefree com bookmarklets keywords html javascript urls unescaped executed would fix problem search keyword bookmarks example query contains comment josh birnbaum pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment matthew van eerde pdt really annoying problem recommend severity normal understand utility unescaped substitution s really advanced feature select default behavior escape people time proposed solution different s style wildcards escaped unescaped substitution would work great long default behavior escape better would check box bookmark s properties whatever name default value check box default behavior escaped substition least urls frequently google searches signs example google browser comparisons mozilla s converted spaces google never sees know could look hex value type dd browser comparisons ddmozilla s silly four extra keystrokes people want escaped unescaped site could make two bookmarks url different keywords comment brad town pdt ve written example bookmarklet gets us little closer without change code base s perfect javascript function var s http www google com search q s s replace encodeuricomponent location href s searches google use inside allow user put anything want either substitution bookmark give keyword things like g comeau c work properly work cases like g rosemary s baby single quote note use single quotes double quotes google searches extremely common comment matthew van eerde pdt would n t g rosemary s baby work wanted search something single quote comment brad town pdt hmm tries yep works s still bit inconvenient though especially creation new keyword bookmarks though tried make simple bookmarklet fill void get sort true solution comment matthew van eerde pdt wfm withdraw severity normal recommendation comment matthew van eerde pdt fwiw s tweaked version bookmarklet javascript var http www google com search q var q escape replace b s replace q location href void line broken readability javascript var http www google com search q var q escape replace b s replace q location href void comment matthew van eerde pdt er g tweaked version dependency think multiple substitution case would seem simply handled using multiple s bookmark http www example com page foo bar call example fish http www example com page foo bar fish comment hans andreas engel pst basically two conflicting user scenarios multi term queries require encoded b queries containing special characters umlauts etc need encoded encode characters except keyword substitution would work almost cases remaining flexible course searching p google keyword would still work comment hans andreas engel pst created attachment details diff review encoding characters except keyword substitution patch encoding characters except keyword substitution since encoding utf specified e g searching google using http www google com search ie utf q works fine umlauts comment matthew van eerde pst would n t need add list escape exempt characters bringing comment gervase markham gerv pst s wrong idea comment gerv comment hans andreas engel pst matthew yes escaped fine queries since search q a b generally interpreted name q value a b gerv imo idea comment comment appealing downside solution existing multi term queries break replaced solutions comment comment seem reasonable would like see one implemented comment hans andreas engel pst created attachment details diff review encoding characters replacement complete urlencoding encoding solution according comment comment also fixes bug comment gervase markham gerv pst think bug bug duped want multiple different parameters gets allocated rather single parameter gets placed occurrences need split text first space whitespace allocate member list run list members ses still seems like right fix _this_ bug gerv comment hans andreas engel pst indeed bug asks multiple replacement parameters

one big chunk line breaks anything perhaps one big text element poke little still text file support actually working right plugin support clean comment deneb meketa pdt hi flash player developer chiming netscape plugin n t support msaa yet ve made work activex seems likely ll turn netscape plugin eventually question pass through arrangement intended plugins msaa architecture pretty simple d like confirm details ie msaa proxying well interesting lessons obvious piece represent plugin child object whatever contains html pane table whatever connection html container element plugin s root object straightforward msaa client probably going assuming traverse tree iaccessible objects html page regardless whether contained plugins thus iaccessible html container asked children code behind iaccessible needs recognize plugin present send wm_getobject message plugin probably via accessibleobjectfromwindow include returned root object plugin among child objects thereafter client communicate directly plugin via iaccessible returned pointer however must careful com reference count accounting obtain iaccessible pointer plugin treat would com pointer calling addref release needed possible wrong proxying strategy plausible alternative hand iaccessible role window represent plugin client smart enough try locate hwnd object ca n t done directly client would compare screen rects qi iolewindow support call accessibleobjectfromwindow hwnd relieving browser responsibility plugin s iaccessible objects might explain ie always provides iaccessible role window wrap plugin way anything weird happening plugins s possible clients depending ie esque behavior providing window wrapper meaning might consider s possibility hope one considering would evil browser could pretend msaa client recursively obtain iaccessibles plugin hand proxies objects would bad unnecessary hassle browser might interfere subtle forms communication client plugin another general issue aware focus screen readers esp jaws depend heavily receiving correct sequences focus events may include focus events sent via msaa also hooking overall windows system focus way subtle timing bugs ie cause focus events come wrong order destroy ability plugin work correctly screen reader guess maximally anal d say get touch directly screen reader vendors s order get flash working idea implementing msaa support generic spec screen readers instantly see content perfectly bit misleading although case mozilla precedent ie sets whereas flash working new different kind content made confusion maybe re okay without

even realize mozilla indirectly actually asking first steals file associations comment kai schaetzl pst original bug filed mozilla taking default browser position although n t tell bug seems closed merged one since still get emails verified mozilla n t anymore also found mozilla n t setups applied current installation custom one think n t even ask default browser launched first time asked actually automatically launched right installation said respected n t seen change yet difference default browser file associations mentioned recently set browser default also grab htm l file extensions otherwise n t make sense default browser default default open command html files wo n t launch one opens html file still open links favorites etc wo n t open html files making fact like half default browser image file association initially set default ie and or windows image viewer windows later change default browser back ie m quite sure ie touch case another image viewer default case fresh windows installation think reason preview folder function explorer windows explorer m sure preview stops working un associating ie never use however know mozilla install grabbed default

currently assigned ca n t imagine situation somebody would want mozilla image viewer opposed number better suited applications unless n t currently one associated filetypes image viewer already use

annoyance d like see neither things comment michael lefevre pdt mozilla default image viewer believe question asked image viewers currently assigned think pretty much never case believe ie default

good idea mozilla ie ns m guessing original reasoning comment aaron kaluszka pdt also comment d need stuff like default ftp client etc backend condition handle bug point n t want lots config options

comment cyrus patel pdt m still opinion best follow kiss keep simple stupid principle preferences dialogs complex enough fulfill purpose respect bug well enough n t need changing issue stake therefore actually starting mozilla _first_time_ finds default browser make mozilla default browser message box currently pops actually quite sufficient logic behind yes selection intelligent currently

semantics closing dialog big enough issue warrant greater discussion issue actually implement new behavior comment reading bugmail pst try build like say talking sad pulled sake shorthand dm download manager pd progress dialog like implementation even better thinking maybe need pause resume button dm toolbar enough instead context menu since already necessary ones since launch never works pd dm sounds like mac guys want use two dialogs dm guys want change like build user wants pd pref use older pd seems crowd n t wan na use dm bill functionality overlap find way code right case clause dependent pref settings wise sounds like solution use two seperate pd s get result case dm usage need pd patch went could one close close brings focus back dm show still downloading cancel button triple pause resume blank area button case pd usage need old pd code need older pd dialog changes although believe launch file seems aways greyed out does n t work would allow user dm open chosen

simply combine completely useless step step remove need extra click login server immediately download message count messages let get platform issue use mozilla windows feedback form icon windows

upon groupmark current workspace destructive behavior definitely bothersome could harm tab browser acceptance think reconsider s late comment christopher aillon sabbatical receiving bugmail pdt thanks marlon agree something get m bringing nav triage today comment nick_jenkins pdt fresh perspective someone started using mozilla say kill everything else on open group bookmark behaviour really bad first time happened went wtf tabs go time happens says metaphor used broken might thinking replace implementers s sure normal user going think going happen arguments favour tend say use back button response s rather lame means ca n t keep well open group b users get confused lots tabs response true even losing current tabs immensely confusing s annoying quibbles one ve thus far motivated enough comment however whilst m might well mention handful things implementations tabbed browsers number years iron ui quibbles main one use regularly netcaptor http www netcaptor com effectively tab browser wrapper sits top ie like mozilla lot aiming use almost exclusive months give good go using netcaptor areas tabbed behaviour stand quite slick could namely groups closing everything else behaviour described existence group bookmarks differentiated normal bookmarks early versions netcaptor much nicer idea bookmark folder group first item says open favourites choose opens bookmarks current bookmark folder away need group bookmarks means move bookmarks say check morning news folder much nicer use well implement would imagine would also simplify manage bookmarks tool imagine also away need file group tick box tabs load give colour indication loaded like simple reflection progress bar shows status bar group opened initially every tab opened starts red block s tab loads goes yellow steps yellow totally finished goes green allows group opened using dial up modem user go get coffee whatever come back start reading pages finished loading pages read ones continue loading s quite pleasant use go loaded page loaded page tabs multiple rows opposed mozilla ever seems one row gets crowded especially useful tabs open rows since see everything probably get first characters every html title tag furthermore width tab reduced title page small helps lots tabs whereas mozilla tab appears get certain amount width tab ctrl n opens new tab rather new window fact ca n t open new window tab implementation good never need want find opening new window bit annoying option load whatever tabs open browser closed means quit browser log come back later reopen whatever tabs open finish whatever n t finished reading s quite handy anyway know s lots stuff s million times easier suggest things actually build please take suggestions friendly spirit intended comment peter trudelle

testing user load bookmark group tabs right selected one replaced included selected one new tabs added necessary replaced tabs restored back button loading bookmark group wo n t increase number tab well suited scenario user number tab greater number bookmark group use bookmark group working set selecting first tab loading group working loaded tabs reselect first tab reloading group etc way group

hixie reading bugmail pdt behaviour think pierre describing imho confusing behaviour believe marlon describing one supporting imho simplest users namely one bookmark bookmark group case act exactly single bookmark additional bookmarks bookmark group appended end comment peter trudelle pdt read correctly result scenarios would group grouped words first bookmark group acts like bookmark active tab subsequent bookmarks opened end tab bar may intervening tabs part groupmark group would contiguous tab bar think important groupmarks open contiguous tabs regardless whether appended open new window inserted active tab location comment pierre chanial pdt agree peter group tab split problem current version patch christopher group tab systematically appended even browser contain one tab about blank means possible use openbookmarkgroup opening new window filling bookmark group since home page still investigated implementation following replace selected tab first bookmark group insert others right selected ones addtab simply used insertbefore instead appendchild unfortunately hit bug tab ordering let s say tabs c insert tab b c results tab bar b c instead b c look dom level b nextsibling

nick_jenkins pdt tend agree christopher aillon ian hixie hickson tabbed browsers ve seen append current tabs i e replace current tab even group one bookmark benefit always keeping new group tabs

tabs focusing first tab group previously focused tab never changes say comment djk pdt like christopher see blank problem like whole tab group appended single tab group need n t act like normal

bug take pref account comment jason bassford pdt fwiw think focused tab replaced st tab group tabs group inserted focused tab tabs right keeps tabs contiguous grouping n t think anybody really objects keeps usage bookmarks consistent single bookmarks work single bookmark currently focused tab replaced hixie points comments group bookmark comprised one bookmark behave regular bookmark think group bookmarks behave close single bookmarks much possible avoid confusion also maintain grouping prevent dataloss seems logical way back button would change focused tab back previously inserted tabs would remain tabs continue added end current tabs currently rather replace insert behaviour suggested changing tab focus st tab group based already existing tabbed browsing preference load links background said although preferred old replace behaviour acknowledge validity current approach recognise hanging left tab blank home page always close since s annoyance better thing live potential dataloss prevented hope tweak bit get best worlds replacement worry people would either realize one tab overwritten easily find group loaded since would looking focused tab content would change immediately

like context menu idea lack discoverablity although context menus bit advantage key binding rather open new tabs part context menu feature remains undiscovered new chance upon right clicking suggest bookmarks ui simply append option bookmarks listed folder folder contents enumerated e g bookmarks folder bookmark bookmark bookmark open new tabs believe something multizilla although looked briefly ca n t recall definitively whether could use ui design would mean function would easily discoverable normal usage patterns btw anybody aware fact within bookmark manager insert regular folder bookmarks tab group folder tried curiosity see would happen wondering bug would treat nested folders lets actually clicking tab group ignores nested folder n t bookmark manager prevent dragging pasting creating folder inside tab group folder one final note n t know actually replace current bookmark groups much augment consider currently bookmark group takes little ui space bookmarks menu s single icon bookmark groups removed replaced regular folders ended selecting folder would expand onscreen show bookmarks seeing single bookmark group icon much cleaner visually seeing whole lot individual bookmarks expanded folder comment garth wallace pdt like idea additional open item folder s submenu rather control clicking context menus comment carsten schlipf pdt guess much possible

anomalies display specification borders linked images problem mozilla seems similar long standing situation n x example url may get chomped bugzilla two forms http gair firstpr com au public files moz bug space in linked image test html http gair firstpr com au public files moz bug space in linked image test html please see box s border linked image stuff page fuller analysis default arrangement composer make border specification image applies link causes composer show two pixel border accordance msie mozilla s browser n x contrary opera shows border default arrangement occurs link added three normal methods lead link tab image link properties dialog box show border around linked image option ticked left default ticked state default arrangement also occurs link added right click create link method leads different apparently unique dialog box option regarding borders anomaly subject bug relates problems right click create link per bug problems outcome seem browsers display border none specified html composer lead html author think requested border b composer add border specification internal data saved file despite scenarios indicating user taking action create border therefore due awkwardnesses image properties editor many users figure create border specification image awkwardness border specification way specifying border details pressing advanced edit button pulling attributes list selecting border option typing value maybe awkwardness adding border image bug non default arrangement link added one three normal means listed option show border around linked image manually deselected deselected default previous use option deselected option deselected composer adds border image specification seem like particularly likely outcome requires user actively deselect option regarding borders primarily thinking images links however seems entirely happy outcome image border attribute user easily see alter image properties editor without fumbling advanced edit button etc means easily change value including create thicker border may desire b long left border composer mozilla s browser browsers know display border anomalies seem one four ways adding link provides options controlling border results unhappy outcome unhappy outcome results three ways adding link user leaves show border around linked image selected anomaly outside world beyond mozilla browsers display border linked image border attribute suggest solution composer ensure every linked image border attribute default value alternatively default value set parameter edit preferences composer discussion somewhat relates following bugs extraneous spaces often link underlined following linked image image right click create link inconsistent ways adding link create link option right click menu link highlighted comment kathleen brade pdt cmanske comment charles manske pdt explained bug n t think supporting insertion image link dialog necessary want create linked image use image dialog agree default behavior adding border image used link confusing old ie also always shown well insert image go link tab default behavior always show show border around linked image checked user uncheck n t wa n t border n t think anything else composer unless suggesting always assume checkbox unchecked brade think good idea bug would would seem change layout behavior never show border around linked image would layout rfe comment robin whittle pdt wrote bug sure charles understood concerns bug right click create link menu item irrespective s think border situation suggest alterering interpretation html browser behavior suggestions purely composer understand browsers display pixel border image link unless specific border specification contary current behavior composer three main approaches adding link image right click create link approach show user default ticked option show border around linked image write border specification image tag display two pixel border however browsers interpret lack border specification image link mean two pixel border instance opera displays border furthermore resulting image edited image properties appearance blank solid border parameter counter intuitive since visible pixel border browsers display however user deselects show border around linked image option border specification created subsequent image properties appearance editing show solid border see two questions composer default put border around images link done assuming moment default composer add border functionally believe create explicit border specification image tag would firstly make browsers display user sees composer secondly cause composer show image properties appearance alternatively default show borders explicit border added think former approach would better way newbie users generate images links visible borders see composer border appears browsers border matches behavior underlining colours text links want get rid digit appearance section alter robin comment kathleen brade pdt agree robin seem inconsistency write border attribute outlined comment composer munching attribute serializer default checked vs unchecked n t really thought defer someone else comment charles manske pdt brade border attribute munching going robin simply observed ns ie show default pixel border image link border specified much original comments link around border created addressed patch bug m making default state show border around linked image checkbox thus without explicit user action border written wo n t hurt always write border checkbox checked though fixup images user never examines images dialog still show differences oberserved different browsers comment charles manske pdt created attachment details diff review patch v default show border around linked image checkbox unchecked inside link border attribute always written assumed user value supplied checkbox unchecked comment robin whittle pdt sounds good agree fix always writing explicit border attribute images composer puts link around making default user ticks show border around linked image option good thing solve editing files images without border attributes already within links display pixel borders composer browsers ways fixing would global addition border images perhaps user option control command find fix images global changes html semantics avoided since impact options commands would benefit browsers follow usual behavior n t think worth worrying present charles wrote link around border created think means modifying image link trying avoid awkwardness adding link image could mean link points action adding image modifying image link probably makes sense user s point view since probably see link something belongs image html level link something image within pedantic terminology since found loose terminology breeds confusion immediately later discussion single image within link n t investigated happens link encompasses image multiple images text

way bug understanding right re admittedly slightly bloating html source create opera n t display linked images way every known browser displays want sanity check make sure s really want unnecessary attributes one beefs composer make like using pages granted border small amount bloat pages images comment robin whittle pdt regarding html bloat adding border images within link arguments good idea firstly nothing formal html standards mozilla aims comply says browsers display pixel border linked images lack border attribute maybe specification n t know adding attribute justified gives browser explicit instructions html author wants displayed may affect opera users sufficient justification view also affect future users potential proliferation degenerate software performs browsing functions foresee standards slipping field everyone dog go writing stuff scratch increasingly diverse range purposes wrist watch browsers fridge door browsers browsers written people ca n t use large already

144072,General,bzbarsky,FIX Reduce cost FlushPendingNotifications want access content lists high cost must flush content sink flushes nscssframeconstructor able access purely content things without triggering creation frames subsequent reflow bad often unnecessary reflow end notifications need rethought anyway currently way flush perform contentappended every time container closes container children rather arbitrary way handling flushing believe content sink flush everything immediately let individual observer sort bug track changes ideas others come current thinking deal add children containers children list immediately upon creating children send every single append insert removal immediately sink document let document handle way could done step making document take burden flushing make document observer send notifications immediately let observer handle notifications way content lists fixed handle appends either immediately lazily would make receive notifications immediately therefore anyone looking content list longer flush nscssframeconstructor really batch effective queue notifications flush time either someone flushes frames specifically need frame reason every quarter second something along sending notifications immeidately sink document would get rid bug completely pushing real timer comment john keiser jkeiser pdt bug eventually fix bug fix

pageload time computer encouraging comment john keiser jkeiser pdt making note fixed bug work around going work around bug well let us back guys fix comment john keiser jkeiser pst sad wait comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt think jkeiser right idea moment flushpendingnotifications flushes following sink s content model frame model pending reflows including ones generated pending viewmanager invalidates note sync paint least linux since widget code n t told invalidates posted gtk flush m proposing add step maybe style reresolves bug lot dom consumers care list lot dom consumers care places actually want n t think anyone really cares minimally intrusive would changing flushpendingnotifications take bitfield would cause flushes relevant things convenience values like layout content frames reflow something alternately could take jkeiser s approach make major changes html sink d still need bitfield though thoughts ve seen bunch dhtml profiles flushpendingnotifications really hurting performance process would worth evaluating really need flush comment robert o callahan roc mozilla corporation pdt sounds good n t think anyone really cares screenshot based regression tester comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt roc cares work note n t actually paint flushes invalidates widget layer also thoughts m looking two approaches take wrt

comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt ah missed composite call comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt ok tad investigating looks like html sink already supports flushing tags make content model date without notifying document observers though codepath n t actually called anything moment look correct splitting flushes described n t _that_ bad one thing decide first though flushes imply ones moment setup flushing reflows first flush content model frames want enforce want make possible flush pending reflows without flushing stuff also looked jkeiser s patch bug m sure like would insert nodes tree immediately kids parsed would break things depend inserted till happened scripts make things slower nodes handle child insertion differently depending whether document eg style comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt ok proposal follows add moznotificationtype enum header la nschangehint include header nsicontentsink nsidocument nsipresshell change flushpendingnotifications methods interfaces take moznotificationtype fix impls callers accordingly one issue exactly nsipresshell flushpendingnotifications moment flushes reflows presshell without flushing reflows parent

145048,MailNews: Backend,mozilla,offline actions run sync weeks trial error finally figured playback offline actions ve found whole system quite precarious actual functionality tremendously useful powerful hard use almost worthless see maybe ve got wrong download sync go offline mode click offline icon download sync dialog part works fine problem basically next time click online button playback begins whether actually talk server mention go online browser window playback never occur least sure heck ca n t figure actually happening case seem get one shot playback lost folders go back state server get one chance re screwed situations bit today came whole bunch offline work plugged laptop clicked offline button mail status bar forgot plug network got failed connect nsmail mcom com dialog boxes realized happening plugged network cable rest playback seemed go ok offline folders seemed actually sync correctly folders seem gone back way went offline hours earlier another way affected connect laptop internet n t access company s mail server i e outside firewall n t want loose offline work server yet another odd case m using netscape s webmail authentication system fails connect server happens time s netscape s bug loose offline sync info server m basically screwed sync finally twice ve accidentally clicked offline icon m actually offline sending back online mode offline changes lost anyhow s think happen pretty much solve problems every time go online window mail window ask would like sync offline work server least user knows sync happening optionally go online browser window mail window would remember gone online got focus could ask offline sync begins first connection server fails ask something along lines ca n t seem connect server would like continue syncing server instead ininformative ca n t connect server could continue trying sync servers cc ing jglick ui behavior advice n t think feature completely thought least nobody tried use real world situations comment grylchan pdt hey alec trying understand situation better re right go online via browser n t sync mail see bug another bug unsent mesgs quit restart login messenger prompted send unsent mesgs pref enabled see bug offline prefs set either main pref area going online ask auto send unsent mesgs dont send going offline ask auto download dont download mail news account settings offline disk space pref section make mesgs inbox available m offline m wondering re running bug create new folders select offline m curious offline changes lost lose sync info loose offline work server say another way affected connect laptop internet n t access company s mail server i e outside firewall n t want loose offline work server yet another odd case m using netscape s webmail authentication system fails connect server happens time s netscape s bug loose offline sync info server m basically screwed sync finally twice ve accidentally clicked offline icon m actually offline sending back online mode offline changes lost mesgs thought downloaded n t mesgs deleted get undeleted labels message status goes new read mesgs get downloaded stay downloaded whether connect server think sending unsent mesg connected mail server and or network wo n t disspear unsent mesg folder understand maybe better informative error mesgs thnx comment alec flett pdt sorry lose actions perform messages mostly deleting moving one folder another well reading message get marked read lose information go re read messages already read re delete messages already deleted highly suggest someone try least weeks try use offline mode exclusively day reconnect morning arrive disconnect reconnect lunch disconnect pretend n t know magic incantation makes offline playback happen try different situations go online network cable unplugged go offline online etc basically experience user experience simply n t robust specific set actions make everything happen right mess one step lose offline work might done also prefs ask every time go offline online make messages available inbox comment david bienvenu pdt offline playback supposed happen go online mail n t know decided go online browser though suspect ve keeping browser separate e mail select folder offline events example select inbox events inbox get played back n t seem like magic formula presumably re going select inbox point playback happen pretty much transparently without lot special steps part ll check make sure s still true s way since lost playback go online fact online s also way since unfortunately offline playback code zoo iterations recursion asynchronousness think original implementer thought safer remove offline op attempt rather completion event obviously bad lose one offline action every offline action e g might lose fact read first message fact read messages deleted others try rewrite code lose first event s scary s possible instead losing events try attempts multiple times resulting errors alerts etc think first thing figure re losing events first event comment alec flett pdt hrm n t know x n t use offline feature much worked unix client offline current world almost always loose playback info i e always means time would appear one thought say somehow keep loosing playback state information inbox maybe mozilla re downloading headers re filtering maybe s bug somewhere inbox losing playback data case seems like constantly going back re reading deleting messages reconnect network honestly feel like must user offline features wonder someone qa banged week tried use real client rather going regression tests known behavior real usability issues could nailed m sure hood things working designed simply usable current state comment david bienvenu pdt trust re offline user know bugs filed fixed lengthy e mail correspondance people using extensively one solaris even m sure s something different useage profile s sort regression comment david bienvenu pdt little research s happening go online w o network connection try playback first offline op fails removed s also happening re clearing flag folder says offline events folder s events n t get played back connect network offline events still fact go offline make change go back online recent change except lost change first offline session get played back m suggesting workaround evidence s losing folder offline events flag offline events suspect go complete solution try delete offline events complete take however comment alec flett pdt see magic formula thanks research ca n t wait easy use offline system comment grylchan pdt alec build using trunk branch pr assume linux old x migrated profile new profile assume imap mail accounts david bug offlie no network connection one alec maybe running bug comment david bienvenu pdt one possible easier solution would offline playback first attempt select folder s playing back offline ops succeeds start playing back removing ops s extra overhead server since folder s likely going need get selected anyway playback offline ops comment kathleen brade pdt probably happened yesterday causing lose hours offline e mail actions am today thinking problem going suggest something like david suggests comment dummy action essentially ignored except flag network problems think important issue address next release due likelihood failure criticalness issue dataloss loss organization comment david bienvenu pdt d prefer cheapen dataloss keyword save situations really lose data otherwise becomes less meaningful promise s getting release since much safer fixes serious offline bugs shot w o second thought comment michael buckland pdt discussed mail news bug meeting decided minus bug comment david bienvenu pst bug marked duplicate bug comment jquinn pst mis classifying experience bug bug read comments see growing exasperated annoyed saw important bug ignored would agree data loss least one occasion responded twice message thought new since internet connection unreliable consistently lose offline changes offline categorically unusable spend hours using word processor write document n t save s data loss spend hours using mail program fundamental part mail program classify respond communication s data loss hard disk file table got munged still files lost datestamp wrong folders s data loss still mail messages lose state wrong folders s data loss status location might dozen bytes actual information important dozen bytes totally lost comment jquinn pst ps comment would fix problems case connection broken middle playback would personally happy case entire playback folder started beginning next time connected ie events flag get cleared folder unless server least responds errors fine every event playback would n t need dummy select action either still fix comment would make ecstatic offline would least usable big picture lot mail clients suck offline capabilities imo fixing one bug would take mozilla far behind the pack ahead of the pack comment david bienvenu pst created attachment details diff review proposed fix fix makes advance next folder case errors playing back operations means case selecting folder lite select fail wo n t lose offline operations case connection failing middle playing back operations might still lose one operation n t lose comment david bienvenu pst cavin get review thx comment reading please use
