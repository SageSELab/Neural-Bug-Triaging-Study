comments well posts netscape public mozilla mail news seems reasonable demand removal attachments comment matt coughlin pdt interest time relatively simple change addresses core demand reducing size mailboxes minimal impact issues mailbox integrity portability anti virus e mail scanning signed documents etc would help move things along considerably afterwards people pursuing comprehensive convenient flexible change might overlap replace initial change users would able start reducing size mailboxes migrating away previous e mail client interest making change looks do able suggestion initial change automatic external storage attachments re first downloaded forget opens too ugly worms resolved timely fashion far av scanning e mail integrity preserving filenames received attachments may name may raise concerns portability mailboxes user migrates different e mail client would still able access external attachments directly e mail might perceived user lock in feature would discourage users migrating mozilla issues would adequately addressed feature could potentially added later add ui options deleting one attachments current message comparable existing ui options saving attachments nothing fancy consistent existing ui options saving attachments delete could left posed much problem keep code deleting attachments separate code saving attachments basically leave code saving attachments as is simply add separate code specific deleting attachments pop up windows menus allow user save delete attachments one action attempting alter existing functionality related attachments possible s less convenient one step automatic save and delete s convenient able delete attachments delete requested attachment current message replacing attachment data text identifies

issue adequately reliable portable way wrt mbox format approach wo n t corrupt mailbox cases platforms another issue e mail integrity would deletion attachment much violation integrity e mail course users still manually delete attachment want may want decide s acceptable alter e mail deleting attachment decide s acceptable n t users might like deprived choice deleting attachments another related issue possible delete signed documents n t know anything signed documents certificates personally ve heard people voicing concerns long s reliable way detect attachment e mail signed easy disable delete attachment functionality message e mail needed possible modification text info could added specifying external location attachment allowing user open attachment clicking text info sure yet mozilla supports type hyperlink local file however raises issues e mail integrity user saves file different name would additional info need added specifying original name attachment e mail portability avoiding possible user lock in mail clients n t support hyperlink approach well general issue relying hyperlinks easily broken user moves files might best skip modification linking external attachments av e mail scanning n t issue since new functionality would deleting attachment mailbox s got pretty safe thing far av software goes d imagine three cases someone would want remove attachment mailbox file n t need attachment n t need access attachment directly e mail ve already saved attachment n t want taking space mailbox need access attachment directly e mail n t want taking space mailbox text info specifying location would accomplish hyperlink local file supported suggested change would satisify cases comprehensive change could done later would needed satisfy third case change variation seem like reasonable step right direction glad hear feedback matt comment ted pdt long attachments removed without losing original header information n t forward mail minus attachments back thus create new header imho anything reasonable first step leap forward n t know others really n t care much link file feature means delaying basic feature would n t hurt much useful

unless s major difficulty adding info received e mail d consider adding filesize date deletion s thought important enough s easy enough generate info n t visibly clutter e mail much l seems bit better since s last letter reminds e important really oh yeah n t thought seems like good reason lean slightly towards l reasonable leave context menu displayed attachments as is right click displayed

deleted attachments s s least record evidence alteration made way message altered whether mozilla use info user easily visually tell messages altered attachments deleted s different matter quickly gets issues user lock in s mozilla specific behavior user becomes dependent visually keeping track alterations messages granted borderline case current three priorities bug making simplest change possible avoiding user lock in making change s personal interest personal interest may sound selfish whole s keeps people motivated enthusiastic enough volunteer time free s drives open source development general everyone scratching unique itches case ui helps user visually keep track altered messages fails three criteria adds awkward level complexity ui introduces user lock in gut feeling s something m interested using might mind someone else adds feature attempting add would cause loss interest working bug actually happened earlier realized quickly found renewed enthusiasm m intending make minimal change s totally free bells whistles nothing fancy ideally others could use building block additional features deleting attachments sent messages adding visual indication altered messages using filter automatically delete certain attachments one folders deleting saving attachments possibly link saved location etc fundamental starting point place first establishing s acceptable possible alter existing message mozilla small thing bug potential much longer term people likely guessed worst case might first require new mail format created implemented mozilla perhaps superset rfc might hold next major rewrite underlying architecture mozilla netscape real possibilities s also possible d take one years gradual spare time effort learn existing architecture well enough begin adding change least mean time maybe someone make relatively easy to use hack tool deleting message attachments outside mozilla maybe even something visually list messages related attachments given folder letting select ones want delete hack tool would n t necessary deal architecture theoretical standards compliance mozilla real difficulty difficulty bug n t understanding mbox format part pretty simple hey d hack like edit mbox file hand long works n t corrupt data meets needs anything fair game s data far home usage e mail least m sure d plenty people included could use tool short term know perl

respect comments motivation please n t let comments stop summary think relatively easy implement valuable replace mime part file mime part another mimetype contains hint missing attachment longer explanation attachments usually multipart mixed mime containers sometimes multipart related etc order completely remove attachments d change mime structure message possibly removing mime container altogether assume non trivial many cases n attachments deleted determining body etc mime part one content part mime container e g type text html image tiff headers determine mimetype maybe original filename etc body content mime part follows suggest simple following replace mime part attachement e g image tiff part inside m mixed container completely different generated part another type example make mime type deleted attachments store original mimetype filename headers body create text plain part store original mimetype filename header generate simple text message contains information human language case d information available structured machine readable format also information mozilla automatically display special display code needed case could relatively easily create another mime type handler libmime could add generated text display time could show attachment attachments box filename deleted something think writing mime type handler hard could give hints believe way namely replacing attachment mime part another part another type hints deleted attachment easier implement completely removing attachment also future proof s go long term imho imho deleting attachments completely existing mails without hint former attachment good idea something users would want hope comment confused obvious course free want mailnews module owner though decide goes mozilla eventually comment matt coughlin pst comment hmmm although would n t ideal solution d consider using plain text attachments d much simpler implement totally removing attachments especially case removing attachments something n t really looked yet d still awkward issues ui use approach d want avoid adding special functionality would treat deletion record attachments differently regular attachments special functionality would contribute user lock in view extent though without special functionality e mail clients user migrates away mozilla later d confusion caused anytime user deleted later deleted linked deletion record attachment user would lose special deletion info accidently re deleted attachment particular consider user deletes attachments message later goes back selects delete attachments message either lose earlier deletion info s special functionality preserve earlier info functionality may add user lock in d comfortable really idea much factor avoiding user lock in everyone else s pretty much top priority past present difficulty migrating away software made certain large company made wary lock in even s purely incidental however possible compromise solution programmatically speaking anyways might use empty nearly empty attachments useful info empty placeholders attachment used d way avoid special info treated differently adding info first place attachment gets deleted second time s loss info mention approach slight miniscule chance d less problematic users d prefer special info rather sometimes losing special info i e n t miss never may way left field line thought d really like set forget approach s special maintenance required afterwards possible s ideal m aiming anyways totally remove attachments d still add headers specify info deleted attachment though would n t add visible indication message altered unless count viewing source message looking headers maybe s really clean way implement bug even paper well s like m committed certain approach yet options still open imho deleting attachments completely existing mails without hint former attachment good idea something users would want understand s bad solution many situations many people s fine anything would overkill would clutter things therein lies dilemma personal interest losing motivation may need aim bad solution least people s eyes order motivated enough work bug s kicker implement even bad solution hurdles would likely cleared someone else come along change way suits people s needs open source development tends effective long enough people pursue s interest anyways way minimize difficulty patch aim simplest solution possible bound please people really think s unavoidable actually best long run start something simple somewhat manageable build one major things learned past half year get past trying please everyone ironically selfish help benefit group long run s really weird works took get realization ll keep options open comment ted pst m speaking strictly user s point view idea implementation problems could mean speculate hey considering user s needs bugzilla n t hmmm although would n t ideal solution d consider using plain text attachments believe would best compromise changing message text presents many problems already illustrated rfc compliance ids etc d still awkward issues ui use approach d want avoid adding special functionality would treat deletion record attachments differently regular attachments special functionality would contribute user lock in view extent imho avoid simple enough original attachment smaller maximum length new attachment would generate instead smaller pre set constant example bytes whatever e g make user definable mozilla refuse delete displaying error deletion would n t noticeably reduce overall message length alternatively display warning ask user really wants delete anyway imho error would suffice done attachment regardless s content hence need special code course use attachment type treat delete supplements whatever instead of attachment would called differently need extra code check simple enough suppose plus extra code display special attachment bit harder believe stick text attachments could put text recognize delete supplement n t need fancy stuff write delete supplement whatever top new attachment simply deny delete attachment contains n t worry much already part first attachment mozilla wo n t delete harm done imho people rarely need delete text attachments anyway s pics movies audios zips large files problem s disk gb consumers beg let problems stop regards teddy comment gilles dumortier pst little idea respect mbox rfc format create new message get new message id clone everything except message id attachment delete add new message text

rfc says many instances messages changed changes constitute new instantiation message therefore message would get new message identifier example messages introduced transport system often prepended

id change seem necessary say standard possibility would use current second format send receive optionally users separate messages attachments wish mozilla option convert first format content type message external body access type local file may say something like save remove attachment message option attachments store attachments folder users may delete separate attachment files later mozilla mail program naturally would option part users decide keep attachments stored current way message files others use option delete separate attachments without need delete messages example options well known email clients eudora separate attachment storage outlook delete attachment option bat two possibilities choose also program dbxtend remove attachments messages outlook express according comments votes bugzilla think possibly great part mozilla mail users would choose separate storage option attachments keep mailboxes small prevent problems like bug deleted inbox receiving virus infected mail

believe way namely replacing attachment mime part another part another type hints deleted attachment easier implement completely removing attachment also future proof s go long term imho imho deleting attachments completely existing mails without hint former attachment good idea something users would want comment involves use content type multipart mixed structure stored message attachments well

attachments using standard mime type content type message external body access type local file forgot mention well timeless proposed mime solution message external body comment bug besides example given padraig comment shows email program mutt also uses message external body way attachments different less standard solutions see details different possibilities email clients example separarte storage attachments eudora uses mailbox sent messages custom x attachments directly general headers message part internal use eudora x attachments c my documents file ext mailbox note end body received message attachment converted c program files qualcomm eudora attach file ext mailbox file eudora program user sees clickable icon file name attachments directory selected user options storage internet transport think eudora email programs probably send receive standard format mozilla mail uses eudora adds custom header x attachments storage anyway rfcs refer mainly communication standards rather storage naturally many email programs like mozilla mail eudora use standards communication internet transport also storage purposes mbox format good advantages like easier import export mail archives etc another example alternative solution separate attachment storage option implemented well known email client bat uses inbox outbox usual content type multipart mixed like standard solution comment custom header x content file attachment part message example bat uses following message part reference attached file separated message file boundary x content file c program files the bat mail user attach rfc mime ps content type application postscript name rfc mime ps content transfer encoding base content disposition attachment filename rfc mime ps boundary instead mime standard reference content type message external body access type local file also suitable used attachment part boundary content type message external body access type local file name c path attach rfc mime ps content type application postscript content id id guppylake bellcore com boundary kind custom header fields x internal use mail clients x attachments eudora x content file bat allowed encouraged several rfcs instance rfc says header fields defined meaning body parts names begin content header fields may ignored body parts although generally retained possible may discarded gateways necessary fields permitted appear body parts must depended x fields may created experimental private purposes recognition information contain may lost gateways rfc multipurpose internet mail extensions mime part two media types multipart media type http www zvon org tmrfc rfc output chapter html sub http www faqs org rfcs rfc html therefore detach attachment files message files making possible way later deletion attachments user x headers internal use used well known email clients allowed private purposes rfcs indeed possible solution bug surely standard mime type see comment content type message external body access type local file although also mainly internal client use case attachments without change present send receive message format internet transport adding optional conversion messages attachments separate storage format would opinion best solution implement option users mozilla mail comment juan m gonzalez pst posted comment bit long short summary following option separate

recommend use standard solutions rather x headers possible see comment mutt email program uses ways time delete attachments content type message external body access type x mutt deleted case people talk external storage direct deletion solutions old good bug ways remove attachments message files difference first case copy removed attachment saved folder second case could call removal instead external storage see removal deletion attachments fact message files like many people would love two options choose solve bug hope available soon later mozilla mail us talked external storage option currently feasible solution bug people s different opinions discussions standards way direct deletion given hand completely standard way external storage would good solution removal attachments direct deletion discussion becomes clearer like eudora mail clients people later delete separated attachments normal files outside mozilla program deletion made later users mozilla n t delete option program saves two files mailbox attachments instead one standard way therefore discussion standards mime type content type message external body access type local file external storage attachments issue significantly greater complexity case simple function implemented first remove file attachments one message time filters option automatic separation attachments eudora style added later mozilla mail currently three options manage attachments message open save save hope least two options added called example delete file remove file remove external storage would exactly successively clicking save separate file delete removing mailbox file save already implemented mozilla mail therefore delete file great little technical complexity problem moment agreement standards direct deletion file

coughlin pst comment s perl think c programs use call perl subroutines way maybe starting point think test possible ideas mozilla patch looks like ton perl scripts mozilla source seems possible call perl script using javascript perlconnect js pm allow calling perl js js perl respectively also came across perl xpcom project open source implementation bindings allow use xpcom objects perl well ability implement xpcom interfaces perl anyways d imagine perl script would potentially useable patch unless support perl still work progress could serve model sort c code write mimicking functionality perl script approach like rigging perl script comparable c code s pretty much isolated rest code base might infinitely easier less problematic adapting existing code base support sort functionality may feasible option getting patch done unless someone considerable expertise mail news module plenty time spare suddenly volunteers work n t seem like s remote chance though rigging something may needed approach might much difficult making stand alone utility unless usage perl xpcom significantly complicates writing perl script d essentially stand alone utility modified somewhat could used mozilla non stand alone fashion anyone see fundamental flaws approach offhand comment juan m gonzalez pst m thinking possibility adding line end experimental script delete attachment pl

notice delete attachments script mozilla closed seems problem later viewing mail mozilla even n t delete mail summary files msf mozilla able manage well display problem appear contrary deleting attachment external script mozilla running time viewing messages mailbox tests attachment deleted case deleting although message new note deleted attachment messages look fine try view messages one deleted attachment mozilla momentary problem find display correctly messages course deletion attachment mailbox suddenly smaller moments think matt correct point anyway example clicking moment another mailbox like inbox coming back test mailbox everithing ok mozilla managed find messages smaller mailbox display problem n t appear unless procedure deletion attachments naturally delete attachment function integrated message window mozilla circumstance viewing message deleting attachments time would usual integration mozilla problem easy fix said external script delete modify msf files mozilla using differently msf files mailboxes modified time without access denied errors think need integration mozilla fix display glitch worst case minor inconvenience testing stage integration mozilla requires couple clicks view certain messages want view immediately deletion attachments running mozilla script time anyway mozilla corrects display fast opinion replacing attachments maybe thousands blank lines would ugly solution mailboxes people want edit fix little display curiosity let s hope possible integration delete attachment function mozilla comment matt coughlin pst comment anyway example clicking moment another mailbox like inbox coming back test mailbox everithing ok mozilla managed find messages smaller mailbox display problem n t appear unless procedure deletion attachments naturally sounds like mozilla able repair index files on the fly partly entirely recreates everytime user selects view one mailboxes mozilla thinking largely static modified message added deleted moved etc s much dynamic self repairing index files may pose little problem deleting attachments d one less layer complexity deal think need integration mozilla fix display glitch fixing display glitch within mozilla may fairly easy like simply requesting mozilla reload mailbox window s pretty easy ask mozilla reload message window instance imagine one would needed least basic ui main menu plus context menu attachments list n t much trouble worked bug last summer reasonably easy figure add delete option ui matter modeling existing code save option btw still small source code changes ui little javascript c xul case turn useful later looking road bit risk getting far ahead things d recommend special ui functionality mozilla differentiate regular attachments remains deleted attachments least initially s completely essential s important keep initial effort simple minimal possible even long run d favor little special ui functionality sort could awkward add might confuse users might reasonable though perl script perform check see attachment remains previously deleted attachment leave attachment d probably also recommend offering undo option initially anyways s likely one first concerns raised think keeping initial effort simple needs high priority expect long run type undo operation available whether undo operation required patch accepted might adequate short term put confirmation window opinion replacing attachments maybe thousands blank lines would ugly solution mailboxes people want edit fix little display curiosity let s hope possible integration delete attachment function mozilla yeah n t much like thought leaving dead space behind either whatever arbitrary data already filling dead space blank spaces carriage returns aside making things awkward users like edit mailboxes hand seems like d asking trouble might occasions would would pose problem like user selects compact folder someone imports mailbox another e mail client instance put another way d like leaving mess someone else clean best avoid leaving mess possible comment content type text html charset us ascii content transfer encoding bit html body center deleted attachment br one megabyte photo jpg br image jpeg center body html d suggest perhaps using plain text rather html text attachment case richer format html might offer advantage s plain text likely wider number e mail clients display whenever user migrates different e mail client comment ben bucksch benb pst realize perl script wo n t make mozilla users usually n t even perl installed start talk perl script bit

possibly step step trying temporary solutions reach integrated solution gradually fifth point documentation perl script ve included ve found important side problem integration delete attachment function mozilla several possibilities translation perl subroutine sub delete_attachment script c function adjusting used mozilla patch instance without current test messages script like attachment found etc translation c would excellent solution stage working point c patch better integration mozilla source code implemented gradually b translation done temporary solution could embed perl

perlcall perl calling conventions c http www perl com doc manual html pod perlcall html c easy procedure convert perl script exe file use command line arguments maybe mozilla utility like perl exe converts example perl script delete attachment pl delete attachment exe file executable without perl installed perl required moment conversion exe perl exe perl indigoperl available http www indigostar com script working temporary solution ways researched greater integration delete attachment function mozilla like adapting drafts procedures take time mimedrft cpp lines code currently e promising possibility would look way mozilla uses already keep labelling information message headers x mozilla status x mozilla status modifying main file mailbox opinion probably complete solution related mailbox modification already made mozilla perhaps mixing attachment deletion procedure script using another integrated way therefore script temporary step towards complete integrated solution delete and or file attachments comment matt coughlin pst comment ben bucksch realize perl script wo n t make mozilla users usually n t even perl installed start talk perl script bit offtopic hoping maybe mozilla built in perl interpreter similar supports javascript instance certain perl scripts least limited form ca n t included found well perl scripts among source files even build mozilla contained perl scripts found mention mozilla documentation things like perl xpcom perl connect usage perl mozilla require user separate stand alone perl interpreter perl scripts perhaps used developer tasks seems like m totally clueless s right hehe ve generally found difficult find much documentation mozilla like support perl format msf files data structures contents message stored seems like documentation exists bits pieces different people s brains side note ve starting wonder lately s lack interest writing documentation part programmers may lingering habits past programming jobs wherein lack internal documentation equals higher job security random thought comment ben bucksch efforts well intended mozilla implementation tightly integrated existing mozilla code n t think perl script much help get bug fixed think know less done general problem integrate mozilla esp somebody actually gut feeling tightly integrated case might possible someone good deal experience relevant source code based past year history bug wait person shows may old even read e mails see two ways forward progress possible divine intervention mozilla hacker planet krypton rigging something interacts existing code base little possible least short term solution think s lot potential benefit current effort putting together perl script even comes separate stand alone utility s still big improvement delete attachments hand using perl script n t option mozilla could used basis writing c code perform functionality test suite able see actual sample data could useful point d like see useable solution deleting attachments whether s part mozilla stand alone utility comment think s time somebody proficient c try go next step s possible similar different programming procedures s helpful know c experience past half year found scale complexity bug code base much contend way beyond means tightly integrating patch mozilla instance would times task could however s possible without deal existing code base much s relatively simple functionality might iffy maybe able help play lead role help writing c making simple ui changes mozilla ve curious learn perl anyways might good excuse get familiar comment matt coughlin pst comment created attachment id experimental perl script delete attachments mozilla mailboxes v m sure s worth worrying consider odd case someone receives message two attachments name s possible create message mozilla s likely possible number e mail clients well anyways point combination message id attachment name might always uniquely identify attachment question m sure s worth worrying thought d point one option pass message id ordinal number attachment i e delete first attachment second one fifth one manual usage stand alone utility s probably safer use attachment name something s used mozilla might slightly safer use ordinal number something comparable minor point comment timeless pst mozilla s build system uses perl mozilla org products use perl

pure business perspective n t think many businesses could ethically implement mozilla client ability manipulate forge communications records s one thing user opening file notepad s another mail client

viruses n t help point recent posting quoting feature would fail rfc compliance mention rfc text quote rfc superceeded rfc added rfc justifies creating new message id discussed earlier thread feel reminded rfc note many instances messages changed changes constitute new instantiation message therefore message would get new message identifier example messages introduced transport system often prepended additional header fields trace fields described section resent fields described section addition header fields change identity message therefore original message id field retained cases meaning sender message wishes convey i e whether message different message determines whether message id field changes particular syntactic difference appears appear message recipient removing attachment change meaning sender wishes convey maybe would think removing attachment replacing placeholder attachment stored preserves meaning mind comment david von oheimb pst reply comment fully

possible solutions seems problem basically mozilla designed around assumption messages never change indeed extent design goal keep message integrity problems seem stem efficient way replace message data efficient way update msf mail summary file images cached therefore deleting attachments n t get rid see thread tb tool n t really convenient classes modifying messages requirement delete attachments goes fundamentally design means solution basically going ugly hack started including requirement would probably use gigantic text files mail store mozilla instead would use database design attachments parsed reception different tables etc sophisticated mail systems like exchange notes etc personally seems like gaping flaw encourages go find something else perhaps asking much mozilla mail comment brodie pst possible parse modify messages mozilla problem code patch attachment details implements save single selected message file replacement message message database contents file

steffen wilberg pst additional comment david bienvenu pdt think going holiday project comment david bienvenu pst long re using berkeley mailbox format stripping attachments involve rewriting message s always going faster rewriting whole mailbox if when support maildir still involve rewriting message someone designs implements format stores attachments separately stripping attachments easy implementing format would orders magnitude harder strip attachments berkeley mailbox format rewriting message w o attachment comment frank pst hiya wanted poke head make couple comments may extension wrote extension thunderbird cuz s use easily made work mozilla tilmann mentioned comment assume made work netscape well would know sure kinda work imap testing needed know n t work standalone message

bienvenu pst looked frank s extension s certainly impressive amount work especially js looks like parses mime message order strip attachment brodie s approach looks like mind using mime parser stream message though iirc s surprising since s approach suggested ll try investigation comment frank pst sorry one thing might gone unnoticed attachment tools extension also implements fuctionality import eml file several current folder meaning one could take eml file really add message store code add text file message store already written added extension want write another whole extension able import eml files know made sense context attachments current version muck around msf files cuz habit locked function core anyway copies original temporary folder also marks deletion original message reads copy line line stripping selected attachments goes saves plaintext modified message array deletes temporary folder get rid msf contains mis information anyway writes array disk using name temporary

detach attachment replace link attachment going stored therefore save delete separate operations wo n t work links get broken later thats user s responsibility concern user could equally delete

would certainly require c albeit much boilerplate also addition lines js suggest could rearrange code m sure wise would long term code currently place implements one set related stream transfer operations see nsistreamtransfer current clean separation front end back end code hopefully enable front end code reused implement progress dialogs majority stream transfer operations moving back end logic js code front end would seem make difficult less ll try advice switching window close however time dialog implemented n t work course m still unsure solve assertion failure m seeing since would n t gotten window close yet btw code worked fine weeks ago used extensively test nsixulwindowcallbacks onload handler adjustments wonder changed cause stop working change fix something else ca n t forego source problem one comment crash john mcmullen reported fixed long time ago coding intricate start up shut down synchronization perhaps huge mess refer problem recall due stream listener

mistake sorry confusion ensued chris correct cause problem need better fix one works hopefully one s much work s plan add two state flags nsdownloadprogressdialog object one indicate whether front end

instead setting front end requested close flag add code downstream completion notification code check close requested flag set calls closewindow basically keep track whether s setattribute call dialog currently call stack avoid closewindow till later one might think closewindow call could issued unilaterally d wrong talk modifying front end prompts user execute downloaded file case closewindow might need deferred till user dismisses dialog ll code see works know make code bigger mess mess hand worth two bush something like comment bill law pdt first tried trick deferring window close using

t like fact view source shows js script source rather generates record disagree js evaluated view source want see on the wire source maybe n t clear enough one reason think bug ie likely ie even able display result following full view source mywin window open windowprops mywin document open write myheader mytext myfooter close subtle difference ben law commented let s say variable myheader currently writing document contains among things something like script type text javascript document write something script would expect result document write show source view source would expect on the wire source difference fact window open set variable referenced open document writing closed document opinion closed intentionally closed therefore new window done loading everything written statement fact able view source everything written document done document fully loaded whereas done fact manipulating dom already loaded document would expect see javascript would writing writing

could give us key could repeat key dialogs well depending exactly answer point provide cancel button although exactly much cancelled point entirely clear incredibly confusing single nice dialog box saying site requires password something like please enter username password name realm username _____________ password _____________ remember password future encrypt passwords please enter key use encryption ____________________ please confirm key reentering ____________________ access site cancel last checkbox key fields appear user yet given key please n t use ok cancel even yes no dialogs

besides playing sound use norton antivirus know im talking new virus deffitions downloaded little box pops right tray saying virus deffintions updated goes away seconds later would hard incorporate

attachment provides proposed interface full set methods manipulate system notification widgets i e systray icons windows interface job navigator quicklaunch systray icon needs need verification work mailnews etc need implement course comment alec flett pst suggestions add local addobserver removeobserver event notifications way possibly even use another well known interface like nsievent way entire system n t notified events one two consumers keep context menus ui interface maybe put seperate nsisystemnotificationmenu interface minimum allow context menus defined xul implemented xul popups ui always manipulated dom interfaces make icon ids urls icons sort css class m almost wondering might want load small xul document represents content might related icon would also give js context work cc ing hyatt ideas comment bill law pst thanks feedback alec replies point local nsiobserver vs nsiobserverservice per widget per menuitem observer nicer would good enough add nsiobserver argument createwidget would support one observer per widget way change observer s probably ok keeping ui interface m sure see benefit separating menu item stuff n t think clients ever going set systray icons equivalent without specifying happens user interacts every client going deal nsisystemnotificationmenu interface anyway new interface bundle simple attributes seems like over comifcation perhaps defining context menus xul problematic n t systray icon windows m sure s possible thus ca n t see low level mouse menu events trigger display context menu could extract necessary information xul document construct native context menu makes things difficult clients suspect increased cabability icon ids urls yes s meant look icon id strings nswidget seticon supports resource urls mapped platform specific files using per platform convention window icons skinnable via css m sure accomplish case case window icons window object s style attributes control icon comment dean tessman pst defining context menus xul problematic n t systray icon windows m sure s possible thus ca n t see low level mouse menu events trigger display context menu n t get mean bill need windows capture mouse click tray icon simple anything want displaying xul window menu comment alec flett pst yes dean said reason first ll add menu item apis people ask icons menus people ask checkboxes people want disable make bold someone want put logo top menu someone want dialog pop instead menu someone want right clicking pop menu left clicking open window list goes ca n t keep adding apis s scalable solution mention ll keep adding proprietary apis instead standard dom apis people know love see literally taskbar icons desktop one thought one main hidden window loads xul document taskbar consumers overlay ui document might save overhead seperate window per icon comment bill law pst anything possible suppose using xul popups seem hard parent window n t one envisioning putting window system tray getting popup way s thing s probably impossible find article somebody wired x window code bit blt window hicon send icon system tray every second used allow put anything wanted system tray quite clever overkill want simple menu managed visible window content event handling suppose could sort hidden window owned menu route notifications systray icon window would show popup hidden xul window source unending aggravation ask danm really hidden popup menus except native mac ones m anxious sign support another one bottom line n t time implement xul based menu system time frame need compromise menu items defined one widgets mouse events limited ones windows sends us win passed observer way ambituous observer interface could implement menu way suggest s ll tell people start asking animated menu
