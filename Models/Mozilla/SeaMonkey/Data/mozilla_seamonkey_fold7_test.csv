another browser ever n t think stopped mozilla make mozilla dream browser one would surely help comment felix miata pdt iirc lotus v introduced concept integrated undo spreadsheets somewhere around think add in available undo function v x never one sheet open time thus tabs file retrieve closed current sheet file opened new one womething undo could completely reverse iirc seems browser problem going back previous page s back button close tab function could made emulate behavior leaving page save entire state page close tab function called saving time undo called browser windows exited

presumed page reload current page needs performed reloads back history pages needs happen like scroll far enough back anyway would really cool non get pages instead displaying modal dialogue asking

back history immediate forward history form data contents filled scroll offset page etc etc might also allow new type bookmark exist goes beyond storing current tab group selection also history states

valuex decryptablevariable must one decryptable variables defined installer engine java specific implementation need add following two decryptable variables program folder drive letter drive user

gathered installer become install path d programme stoffe java well pretty contrived example ca n t remember foreign countries really call program files folder comment dprice gone pdt specifying line configurable file config ini could something like component java configure file filename setup iss line text n t change line installpath program folder drive program folder path line text n t change installer would call decryptvariable line would run risk config ini file s mile long would get information user could make decryptvariable little smarter sees variable name would know expecting user

cramped ui stops showing n t know hardcoded based computer s screen resolution get overflow happening tabs d rather overlow take affect halfway right tabs tabs widths ui remain somewhat usable dropdown menu might good idea ca n t really decide personally d rather scrollbars dropdown menu certainly think grouping anything ip category dropdown box alone grouping proposed separate bug would think affect tabs m favour general s another issue thinking terms extreme cases many many tabs think dropdown box offer following kind entries rather single entry per tab title range would course based many tabs determined display onscreen prior reflow way jump one screen group next use single tabs titles d make width dropdown box quite large accomodate tab titles way width remains pretty

serve use names tabs open somebody please shoot ever want get around rd quarter section tabs would much easier pick would scroll got estimated area d d menu help certain minimal tab size fallen short

sorry bugspam comment john mellor jomel pdt ve working extension allows choose main ways dealing many tabs based suggestions bug bug bug bug thought d summary options bug included observations months testing possibilities particular order arrowscrollbox aka scroll buttons many bookmarks scroll up down buttons appear top bottom bookmarks menu component used show left right arrows either side tabs necessary patch bug makes neater note could done normal scroll left right buttons effect pros little screen space used easy implement cons anyone lots ungrouped bookmarks attest s really annoying wait seconds scroll bookmark wanted way generally quite hard scrolling system use due quirky onhover behaviour fast scrolling making precise selection hard though scrolling also slow traverse set items indication far ve scrolled etc scroll up down buttons windows taskbar part button right hand side tab bar allowing scroll rows tabs one row ever visible time though pros little screen space used easy implement cons many problems intuitive user expects scroll left right up down scrollbar horizontal apparently present quite popular tbe either way scrollbar effective tool scrolling large numbers things unsurprisingly could either scroll tab bar click tab want etc s position directly linked tab index note s way making scrollbars half normal height could nice pros n t take much screen space easy implement easiest use scrolling mechanisms especially since scrollbars inherently allow scroll one scroll row scroll manually cons first time see users might sure though scrolls switch tab ll soon obvious multiple rows controversial option many people want many hate sensible mechanism dealing say rows screen taken adjustable dragging splitter like windows taskbar vertical scrollbar perhaps vertical scroll buttons possibly even dropdown perhaps best way would show inactive rows user hovers tab bar sufficient period case many rows fit screen shown scrolling also think multiple rows tab width remain fixed except perhaps bottom row otherwise tabs would n t line would kept moving around well absolute pain implement note allow number visible rows adjusted dragging splitter could set default hence allowing users choose whether use multiple rows pros tabs accessible unless many open cons screen space go hardest implement well tab menu dropdown menu shows tabs enable instant selection could accessible via entry go menu button somewhere and or keyboard shortcut note could used well one options except perhaps multiple rows important question menu long screen either multiple columns instant access tabs vertical scrollbar unusual fairly effective ui arrowscrollbox standard hard use see cons option would also suggest menu behave like tab bar e g right click get tab right click menu may also nice switch tabs user hovers menuitems menu however low spec systems might suffer could hidden option extension note many people proposed tab overflow menu launched chevron button however sensible tabs implementation make sure currently selected tab always screen except perhaps user scrolls away would need clear separation tabs visible tabs visible even would confusing visible tabs probably shown differently e g italic though active one particular e g bold note really make difference complement could sorted last accessed created case tabs never accessed pros see full er tab titles finding tabs instant access tabs yet little screen space used novices ignore cons erm slightly slow get go menu personally imho implementing testing possibilities find horizontal scrollbar underneath tab bar tabs overflow easiest use scrollbars flexible also show collection tabs list currently open tabs accessible via multi columned popup go menu keyboard shortcut like opera uses ctrl tab perfect complement instant access particular tab needed also found using arrowscrollbox least effective approach reasons explained would recommend notes scrolling solutions st nd rd tabs shown used display automatically scroll keep active tab onscreen though user still scroll away applicable cases new functionality visible tabs start overflowing whatever solution except tab menu may make sense increase default minimum tab width programmed almost everything extension form though firefox would happily convert one solutions patch apologies long post comment h kan waara pdt comment

user interface dialogue box resulting fourth approach lacks functions including show border around linked image option lead user creating file border problems discussed bug still think situation bug

average user presence create link menu item right clicking link less image looks like legitimate way adding link image reflected bug creating link composer right clicking pop up menu gives option

resolution still invalid charles sorry seem pedantic words go trying figure understand point bug disagree whether understandings differ way charles wrote link tab image dialog convienece make easier create link around image yes agree part dialog box appears first three approaches listed want create link image using context menu simply insert image first get pedantic interpretation words link pesky word adding link image way using means modifying image definition contains hyperlink avoiding use word link points issue discussion adding link image could really mean meaning since link point image unless image target case link would point target sentence charles seems indicate thinks referring creating hyperlink somewhere point image case discussing modifying image definition hyperlink pointing something else followed browser image clicked makes think charles misunderstood wrote think would overly complicated create link menuitem dialog always include image attributes simple text link creation makes think charles understanding create link item right click menu generic item creating text link indeed right clicking nothing selected brings dialog box asking text link location right clicking selected text using create link brings box asking link location happens image think charles understanding right click create link menu item generic way creating link whereas understanding one several ways adding link existing image therefore consistent three ways suspect shows discrepancy individual developers think particular menu items many naive users would think bug charles wrote explained bug n t think supporting insertion image link dialog necessary want create linked image use image dialog makes think misunderstands point bug seems think discussing inserting

161466,Preferences,mozilla,Better UI tabbed browsing prefs would much simpler mozilla tabbed mode windowed mode windowed mode would following ctrl click link opens new window ctrl click bookmark opens new window ctrl enter location bar opens url new window file new menu navigator window top navigator tab invisible right click link open new window top open new tab invisible target _blank opens new window tabbed mode would following ctrl click link opens new tab ctrl click bookmark opens new tab bug b ctrl click bookmark folder opens bookmark separate tabs bug ctrl enter location bar opens url new tab file new menu navigator tab top followed navigator window right click link open new tab top followed open new window target _blank opens new tab means combine tabbed browsing prefs single ui pref imagine checkbox read enable tabbed browsing checking would enable tabbed mode note window options still available tabbed mode longer default allow users use combination tabs windows opening related tabs window advantages fewer prefs less ui clutter windowed mode enabling tabs simply turn menu s visibility true switching places described bug s always top always visible greater consistency ui windowed mode resembles ui browsers without tabbed browsing older versions netscape method makes much simpler makes easier promote tabbed browsing single pref enables s also press friendly makes easier describe mozilla s tabbed browsing feature comment jason bassford pdt agree good theory going run problems example see bug comment s user uses tabbed browsing time wants new window new tab wants infrequent thing listed first context menus right away ll disagree points tabbed browsing mode actually came surprise opened bug tabbed browsers would want new tab top apparently s hence change focus bug away hardcoded solution might come bug set default preferences based main one betweeen tabbed browsing windowed browsing along lines select browsing mode use tabs use windows advanced reset way preferences immediately exposed average user picking one mode tune fine grained preferences reasonable set behaviour thing m sure terms ui reset button added way user revert customized changes via advanced default settings tab window mode already selected wording needs better aside think good idea explicity state mode user general likes use several bugs could make use resolution rather making assumptions based setting fine grained control may accurately reflect reality far middle click control click links web page best indicator tabbed browsing use s completely ideal confirming changing platform os comment jason bassford pdt bug comment bug comment comment bamm gabriana pdt think like suggestion better originally wrote slight improvement suggestion patterned win folder options dialog select browsing mode use tabs always open new windows open tabs instead windows custom based settings choose advanced advanced button would open box contains six seven cases outlined reset button becomes unnecessary choose either first two options comment jason bassford pdt yes ui approach better think top level ui simplified select browsing mode open new windows open new tabs customize behaviour advanced user n t certain implications open new tabs always click advanced button even n t checked customize behaviour box see things currently set decide actually change one prefs browsing mode default ui would automatically change customize behaviour selected next time view panel n t want change anything cancel advanced dialogue suggest changing summary bug something along lines better ui tabbed browsing prefs since agree s morphed away single pref s grouping individual prefs much easily understood fashion comment bamm gabriana pdt agree summary changed comment bamm gabriana pdt s imagine advanced dialog box custom tab settings ctrl click middle click link opens new tab ctrl click middle click bookmark opens new tab ctrl click middle click bookmark folder opens bookmark separate tabs ctrl click middle click navigation button history item opens page new tab ctrl enter location bar opens url new tab targeted links open new tab show tab menus note show tab menus option applies new navigator tab menu open new tab menu since makes sense consistency two menus people want window menus top simply deselect people want tab menus top select magically appears top window menus identify bugs depend comment jason bassford pdt something else consider since re letting people choose windowed tabbed browsing probably also include preferences apply windowed browsing example ctrl click link ve currently defined things box checked ctrl click open new tab s unchecked assume re thinking open new window people want ctrl click neither things case simple on off preference insufficient another example load links background currently applies tab browsing could equally apply windowed browsing people might want new window opened want focus remain current window bug opens situation least options load links current window tab load background tab load background window simple on off preference insufficient due whole advanced section needs reworked list section mode browsing tabbed browsing tab display hide tab bar one tab open load links background open new tabs middle click control click links web page control enter location bar windowed browsing open new windows middle click control click links web page control enter location bar anything simple on off like order new tab new window could located one sections probably tabbed browsing section work redesigning tabbed browsing preferences panel stands today add preferences appropriate bugs fixed additions make sense n t see reason check patch right expand things progress redesign really dependencies implementing complete version per initial report ll see come bug dependencies final version note however bugs re fixed may end preference based could hard coded instead still possibilities also m sure way dependencies really going bugs m marking bugs blocking one remove dependencies n t like add others may missed bug open multiple links new windows bug shortcut open links background window bug ctrl click bookmark open new window tab bug javascript created windows appear tabs bug windows open new windows instead tabs bug pref open links background window bug external apps open new tabs windows bug disable tab browsing bug ctrl click bookmark folder bug consistent new window new tab menu order bug tab group load focus ignores load background pref bug urls longer launch new window external app comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt people want window menus top simply deselect m sure great idea user mostly opens new windows new tabs special cases like bulletin board sites documentation gives primarily new window people choice hard to reach options tabs comment bamm gabriana pdt jason also good suggestion wondering though useful since person want open new window tab would simply click really mean use radio buttons think meant check boxes thanks list related bugs keep lose focus scope bug comment bamm gabriana pdt boris choose individual settings via advanced button case either ctrl click open new window show open new tab top menu ctrl click open new tab show open new window top menu comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt well completely honest never use control click never want would much prefer open new window top menu realize m picky long re defining explicitly advanced ui may well make flexible comment bamm gabriana pdt would suggest seems middle click would much faster right click slide down click comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt yes middle click new windows get opened would suggest option items contextmenu new window first comment bamm gabriana pdt hmm read another bug interchangeable menus would confusing new users use one computer however argument seems negated advanced menu might ok imagine though easier code visibility toggle interchanging items please describe would imagine advanced menu maybe put ideas together come something flexible intuitive comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt yes would harder code think decent way expressing ui ll say consider user feedback time comment jason bassford pdt gives primarily new window people choice hard to reach options tabs m sure d call advanced button hard reach like simplicity choosing one mode really want something fine grained still customize grant however advanced prefs reworded well redesigned general friendly last example still wrong lot ways supply better help person want open new window tab would simply click yes still need define happens ctrl click n t like unchecking one section believe wrong think might nothing perhaps rather simply repeating general pref section combine kind chart second attempt advanced menu using dependent bugs points original description bug overall disable tabbed browsing ui hide tab bar one tab open load links background new tabs windows new tab new window current view ctrl click middle click opens control enter location bar opens ctrl click bookmark opens open multiple links external application url opens javascript created window opens menus list new tabs first last note m combining original description bug bug rules inconsistency context main menus really mean use radio buttons re correct d meant use check boxes however see mean use radio buttons grin like example lot better previous attempt also agree flexible make better long ensure n t grow complex needs balance customizability simplicity comment bamm gabriana pdt forgot mention targetted links navigation buttons back forward history items n t becoming little complex might losing intuitiveness approach comment jonas j rgensen pdt yay prefs comment jason bassford pdt forgot mention targetted links navigation buttons back forward history items realised lack targeted links right posted read result simply added re read comments figure navigation buttons history items came n t mentioned original description see comment mean ctrl click dropdown menu items anybody opened bug feature yet case simply added format example important specifics n t becoming little complex given number prefs ll accomodate assuming dependent bugs fixed see way around best get ui friendly possible yay prefs grin n t really generated bug dependent bugs unless ui redesigned current state checked s going real mess grant sense additional prefs directly caused bug per comment seems take advanced pref panel whatever form would end put directly current main tabbed browsing section prefs would alienate regular users far simple selection two different browsing styles advanced button comment jonas j rgensen pdt ctrl click link middle click link ctrl enter location bar ctrl click bookmark target _blank target foo window open etc etc etc open new tab new window one pref opening tabs instead windows need merge em need pref hiding tab related ui otherwise d also need separate prefs hiding bookmarks history printing related ui name need pref deciding order open new tab open new window context menu items file new navigator window navigator tab menu items stay currently regardless pref setting comment jason bassford pdt jonas re saying fine bugs killed get resolved prefs n t see happening somebody always going want fine grained control comment bamm gabriana pdt yay prefs yup make things lot intuitive tabbed mode windowed mode custom much easier grasp individual prefs mean ctrl click dropdown menu items meant ctrl back button ca n t find bug maybe file dupe wait till someone dupes find hehehe see way around since netscape days ctrl click traditionally meant open new window ie s equivalent shift click think saying ctrl click opens new tab instead window straightforward enough n t get wrong like fine degree control think table grown large looks daunting would use checkbox choices radio button

right parent tab behavior chimera netcaptor reasonable compromise requests change way tabs closed ie bug bug bug behavior mentioned comment david hyatt peter trudelle invited bug mozilla implementation behavior comment sander pdt n t think would good thing consider following experience common scenario re looking list links open quite tabs end process link followed first located way right last link followed probably still loading right current tab showing upon closing current tab chances first want read tab opened first example dealing chronological order archived mailinglists search results first want look highest ranked results chance re looking requires manually focussing first opened tab current closing behaviour would focussing tabs constantly opening new tab immediately right current tab opinion beneficial follow one link per page yet strength tabbed browsing regularly follow dozens links however slightly changing proposal think could lead even efficient tabbed browsing requiring less manual focussing already case first tab opened page opens immediately right current tab next tab opens immediately right tab would retain way multiple tabs opening currently works left right inserted immediately next current tab schematically happens three tabs b c open two new tabs pages right a b c a b c a a b b c c proposed a b c a a a b b b c c c proposal a b c a a a b b b c c c biggest problem see proposals re dealing large number tabs might become confusing users identify new tabs opened believe argument inserting bookmark groups immediately right current tab comment r k aa pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment malcolm rowe pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment jason bassford pdt like solution comment better originally proposed bug however still problems overall concept say m browsing news site daily m opening links news want read tab keep main news site open reference point go nd tab read article find stories m interested open tabs original scenario bug revised one comment new tabs open immediately right nd tab close nd tab m finished article next tab m presented first link clicked closed nd tab s want see next want see next nd link clicked main reference page tab way means lose first clicked first read order want keep things s akin problem described comment global level want group tabs terms content would open completely new content sites new windows browse via new tabs respective window think current behaviour works fine comment sander pdt originally would agreed comment thought writing comment realized clickthrough rate usually pretty low meaning hardly ever follow links followed link normal browsing bugzilla happen regularly cases set yet another tabgroup taking example news site _do_ follow link one news articles s usually quick peek around something d rather immediately reading article instead waiting d read half dozen articles forgotten first one agree however current behaviour works fine certainly good enough ll okay way eventually resolved comment boris zbarsky bz vacation jan pdt bug marked duplicate bug comment aaron green md pdt still like comment s solution looks like ultimately need move towards kind grouping tabs consider ex given page basepage open link new tab page tab basepage changes color new tab well tabs created links basepage color one child pages open links new tabs child page children could lighter shade color would make cool rainbow effect wow factors reviewers visually group pages even close given tab pages opened tab would still visually grouped think solves disagreement tabs front close given tab ex m reading child tab close child tab want read children unlike previous poster poster rate able see groupings colors shades idea implemented kind second row tabs row would generally represent tabs children base page question determine row refreshed ex switch tab b second row tabs shows tabs spawned tab b s great however close b might still want see spawned pages b closed perhaps case multiple tabs spawned b b closed switch one b spawned tabs referring tab b could presented ghost main tab line way left second row second row tabs could show tabs spawned b sibling tabs instead guesses user wants see second row consider viewing tab user select second row show tabs spawned site current tab would quick flexible way get exactly group want see regardless tree links viewing natural complement course would function show tabs opened current tab second row tabs one would navigate second row tabs another story p comment aaron green md pst ping hope get least

169380,Tabbed Browser,neil,RFE Add LED tab labels indicate tab load status user agent mozilla windows u windows nt en us rv gecko build identifier mozilla windows u windows nt en us rv gecko tabs load would useful gave colour indication loaded like simple reflection progress bar shows status bar group opened initially every tab opened could start red block s tab particular tab loaded could go yellow perhaps substeps yellow totally finished go green currently tabs indicate either loaded loading extra information would useful would example allow bookmark group opened using dial up modem user prioritise reading tabs either finished loading quite close fully loaded reproducible always steps reproduce s example tier traffic light system tab status shown dialog box point http multizilla mozdev org features html around two tiers indicate various states pending would ideal comment stefan borggraefe pdt would alternative bug comment nick_jenkins pdt created attachment details tab different states loading n t found bug previously thank mentioning yes alternative approach screenshots attached bug quite helpful illustrate ve taken one modified show idea could look like m attaching comment nick_jenkins pdt differences approach one mentioned namely n t use background tab illustrate load progress size tab fluctuates tabs opened closed ca n t look progress bar compare size tab secondly probably much information user wants know roughly loaded something away separate page painting progress bar probably much information user wants know roughly loaded page away spinning arrows n t add anything extra thus suggestion n t use extra space also uses traffic light colours help convey information loaded page comment asa dotzler asa pst marked wontfix re going put progress indicator tab s ui czar comment neil parkwaycc co uk pst could live adding minimum backend allow coloured spinning arrows extension i e would possible install small extension would override current spinning arrows colour code loading progress comment nick_jenkins pst minimal change allow extension progress indication sounds ideal simplest interface conceive something gets passed tab load percentage returns tab icon url along lines default implementation returns b w spinning arrows getloadingtabicon function percentage return url chrome global skin icons loading gif versus extension

image e g tab busy would style comment nick_jenkins pst ahh s good definitely simpler load progress extension could done css icon images extension installed loading tab would look moment i e current spinning arrows icon would match busy percentages yes s much better comment neil parkwaycc co uk pst created attachment details diff review proposed patch changes browser css needed consistency modern changes tabbrowser xml work extension hook comment nick_jenkins pst created attachment details zip file containing aome basic loading gif icons modified userchrome css m trying get load progress icons work much luck strongly suspect m something wrong s ve done ve made patch changes tabbrowser xml extracted toolkit jar modified rezipped back toolkit jar browser css m running firefox could n t find

px height px list style image url chrome global skin icons folder item png moz image region rect px px px px tab busy tab icon list style image url chrome global skin icons loading gif could n t see anything exactly matched change close file path different moz image region line gone margin right px width px height px tab list style image url chrome communicator skin bookmarks bookmark item gif consequently n t make change tried making change tab busy tab icon tab busy however restarting browser resulted spinning arrows icon showing page loading n t sure whether good bad figured case user s custom css overriding inbuilt css figured probably work per normal user customised css conseqently undid change overall changes browser css file made basic x gif icons basic userchrome css m attaching zip file containing files icons put classic jar file classic skin classic global icons also current spinning arrows icon loading gif located restarted browser though standard spinning arrows icon progressive loading icons ve done something wrong tabbrowser xml changes straightforward gif icons seem fine leaves probable mistakes ve made browser css changes n t make userchrome css m making best

also work tabbrowser tab busy true list style image url loading gif important comment nick_jenkins pdt yep works great d much rather css modify code thank s working great default looks exactly small additions userchrome tab load indicators appear good stuff hopefully patch included time next release comment neil parkwaycc co uk pdt well want firefox best bet file new bug component attach version patch comment neil parkwaycc co uk pdt comment attachment details diff review better patch mozilla let s ask moa first comment jag peter annema pdt comment attachment details diff review better patch like idea m sure value best attribute name though call progress could attribute short time set causing rule match might flicker goes site icon bookmark icon comment neil parkwaycc co uk pdt this mtab setattribute value math floor acurtotalprogress amaxtotalprogress slice occurred second digit probably unnecessary anyway change calculation this mtab setattribute progress math floor acurtotalprogress amaxtotalprogress comment nick_jenkins pdt created attachment details sites n t show site icon loaded found best way really test corner cases tab load indicators load tabs causes everything go much slower saturating network link leave everything finished loading see happens update comment definitely better without would occasionally show nothing load state tab finished loading m guessing progress value come guess became slice took effect resulting icon becoming nothing is loaded icon n t happen change comment something noticed though process stress testing small number pages seem end tab icon stuck state fully loaded state i e matches loaded case stay state even page completed fully loading i e top right browser stopped spinning page network activity stopped sneaking suspicion though may problem part browser patch words case change exposing pre existing problem rather causing problem say reasons could n t get go away adjusting patch setting progress value

expected comment nick_jenkins pdt created attachment details screenshot reloading fussy pages even progress attribute removed actually ve realised something like happens pages listed still displaying

pages immediately take screenshot start loaded image attached progress value got set removed loading first time easiest way fix seems explicitly initialize progress zero tab starts loading hard way work onprogresschange gets called busy false s way beyond scope bug also s probably best initialize progress setting busy true well good measure i e make additional modification onstatechange like

perspective something user expected know care pref essentially saying type find two distinct uses use often something user reasonably expected know course users never alter prefs default carefully chosen personally think search text s always use think s understandable mode first time ever used type ahead find confused n t seem work later realised defaults searching links trouble getting grips feature fear average user comment sander pst could n t live without type ahead find anymore actually _want_ third option anything unless preceded either happens far often taf triggered n t want

except vote would new tab reload tab close tab reload tabs close tabs think important put close tab close tabs right top one another allows mouse slippage thus problem complete opposite one another put position one easily clicked went intended also ordering like keeps reload ___ close ____ group ordering tact groups think makes little sense thoughts ll try take look tonight thanks comment tim

otherwise arise browser suite already reload option bottom list would n t huge change though looking layout menu browser suite really baffle ordering ended way n t seem intuitive firefox s layout
